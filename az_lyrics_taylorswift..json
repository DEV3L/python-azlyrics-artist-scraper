impress,\nAnd they're all laughing,\nAnd asking me about you,\nBut there was one thing missing,\nAnd that was the moment I knew.\nWhat do you say\nWhen tears are streaming down your face\nIn front of everyone you know?\nAnd what do you do when the one\nWho means the most to you\nIs the one who didn't show?\nYou should've been here.\nAnd I would've been so happy.\nAnd it was like slow motion,\nStanding there in my party dress,\nIn red lipstick,\nWith no one to impress,\nAnd they're all standing around me singing\n\"Happy birthday to you\",\nBut there was one thing missing,\nAnd that was the moment I knew.\nOoh, I knew.\nOoh,\nYou called me later,\nAnd said, \"I'm sorry, I didn't make it,\"\nAnd I said, \"I'm sorry too,\"\nAnd that was the moment I knew.", "year":

whispered in your ear\nCome on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here\nOut of this curtained room in this hospital grey, we'll just disappear\nCome on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here\nYou were my best four years\nWhat if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?\nWhat if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?\nAnd what if I really thought some miracle would
