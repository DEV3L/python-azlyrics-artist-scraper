"{'album': 'Speak Now', 'title': 'Dear John', 'lyrics': '\"Dear John\"\\nLong were the nights when\\nMy days once revolved around you\\nCounting my footsteps\\nPraying the floor won\u2019t fall through, again\\nAnd my mother accused me of losing my mind\\nBut I swore I was fine\\nYou paint me a blue sky\\nAnd go back and turn it to rain\\nAnd I lived in your chess game\\nBut you changed the rules everyday\\nWonderin\u2019 which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight\\nWell I stopped pickin\u2019 up and this song is to let you know why\\nDear John, I see it all now that you\\'re gone.\\nDon\\'t you think I was too young\\nTo be messed with?\\nThe girl in the dress\\nCried the whole way home, I should\\'ve known.\\nWell maybe it\u2019s me\\nAnd my blind optimism to blame\\nOr maybe it\u2019s you and your sick need\\nTo give love then take it away\\nAnd you\\'ll add my name to your long list of traitors who don\\'t understand\\nAnd I\\'ll look back in regret how I ignored when they said,\\n\"Run as fast as you can.\"\\nDear John, I see it all now that you\\'re gone.\\nDon\\'t you think I was too young\\nTo be messed with?\\nThe girl in the dress\\nCried the whole way home\\nDear John, I see it all now it was wrong\\nDon\u2019t you think nineteen\u2019s too young\\nTo be played by your dark, twisted games?\\nWhen I loved you so, I should\\'ve known.\\nYou are an expert at \"Sorry\"\\nAnd keeping lines blurry\\nNever impressed by me acing your tests\\nAll the girls that you\\'ve run dry have tired lifeless eyes\\nCause you\\'ve burned them out\\nBut I took your matches\\nBefore fire could catch me\\nSo don\u2019t look now\\nI\u2019m shining like fireworks\\nOver your sad empty town\\nDear John, I see it all now that you\\'re gone.\\nDon\\'t you think I was too young\\nTo be messed with?\\nThe girl in the dress\\nCried the whole way home\\nI see it all now that you\\'re gone\\nDon\\'t you think I was too young\\nTo be messed with?\\nThe girl in the dress\\nWrote you a song, you should\u2019ve known.\\nYou should\u2019ve known\\nDon\u2019t you think I was too young?\\nYou should\u2019ve known.', 'year': '2010'}"
