{"lyrics": "\"Better Than Revenge\"\n\"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did\"\nHa!\nTime for a little revenge\nThe story starts when it was hot and it was summer and...\nI had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him\nShe came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause\nShe took him faster than you could say \"sabotage\"\nI never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it\nI underestimated just who I was dealing with\nShe had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum\nShe underestimated just who she was stealing from\nShe's not a saint\nAnd she's not what you think\nShe's an actress, whoa\nShe's better known\nFor the things that she does\nOn the mattress, whoa\nSoon she's gonna find\nStealing other people's toys\nOn the playground won't\nMake you many friends\nShe should keep in mind\nShe should keep in mind\nThere is nothing I do better than revenge\nShe looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list\nShe looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it\nI think her ever-present frown is a little troubling\nAnd she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things\nBut sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know\nOr pushing people down to get you where you wanna go\nThey wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me\nBut no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity\nShe's not a saint\nAnd she's not what you think\nShe's an actress, whoa\nShe's better known\nFor the things that she does\nOn the mattress, whoa\nSoon she's gonna find\nStealing other people's toys\nOn the playground won't\nMake you many friends\nShe should keep in mind\nShe should keep in mind\nThere is nothing I do better than revenge\nI'm just another thing for you\nTo roll your eyes at, honey\nYou might have him but haven't you heard\nI'm just another thing for you\nTo roll your eyes at, honey\nYou might have him but I always get the last word\nWhoa\nShe's not a saint\nAnd she's not what you think\nShe's an actress, whoa\nShe's better known\nFor the things that she does\nOn the mattress, whoa\nSoon she's gonna find\nStealing other people's toys\nOn the playground won't\nMake you many friends\nShe should keep in mind\nShe should keep in mind\nThere is nothing I do better than revenge\nDo you still feel like you know what you're doing?\n'Cause I don't think you do. Oh.\nDo you still feel like you know what you're doing?\nI don't think you do\nI don't think you do\nLet's hear the applause\nCome on show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah)\nSo you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better\nShe took him faster than you could say \"sabotage\"", "title": "Better Than Revenge", "year": "2010", "album": "Speak Now"}
