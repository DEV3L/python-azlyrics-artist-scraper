"{'album': 'Speak Now', 'title': 'Superman', 'lyrics': '\"Superman\"\\nTall, dark and superman\\nHe puts papers in his briefcase and drives away\\nTo save the world or go to work\\nIt\\'s the same thing to me\\nHe\\'s got his mother\\'s eyes, his father\\'s ambition\\nI wonder if he knows how much that I miss him\\nI hang on every word you say, yay\\nAnd you smile and say, \"How are you? \"\\nI say, \"Just fine\"\\nI always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you... forever\\nI watch superman fly away\\nYou\\'ve got a busy day today\\nGo save the world, I\\'ll be around\\nI watch superman fly away\\nCome back I\\'ll be with you someday\\nI\\'ll be right here on the ground\\nWhen you come back down\\nTall, dark and beautiful\\nHe\\'s complicated, he\\'s irrational\\nBut I hope someday you\\'ll take me away and save the day, yeah\\nSomething in his deep brown eyes has me sayin\\'\\nHe\\'s not all bad like his reputation\\nAnd I can\\'t hear one single word they say\\nAnd you\\'ll leave, got places to be and I\\'ll be OK\\nI always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day\\nI watch superman fly away\\nYou\\'ve got a busy day today\\nGo save the world I\\'ll be around\\nI watch superman fly away\\nCome back I\\'ll be with you someday\\nI\\'ll be right here on the ground\\nWhen you come back down\\nAnd I watch you fly around the world\\nAnd I hope you don\\'t save some other girl\\nDon\\'t forget, don\\'t forget about me\\nI\\'m far away but I never let you go\\nI\\'m lovestruck and looking out the window\\nDon\\'t forget, don\\'t forget where I\\'ll be\\nRight here wishing the flowers were from you\\nWishing the card was from you\\nWishing the call was from you\\n\\'Cause I loved you from the very first day\\nI watch superman fly away\\nYou\\'ve got a busy day today\\nGo save the world, I\\'ll be around...\\nForever and ever here\\nI watch superman fly away\\nI swear I\\'ll be with you someday\\nI\\'ll be right here on the ground\\nWhen you come back down\\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\\nWhen you come back down', 'year': '2010'}"
