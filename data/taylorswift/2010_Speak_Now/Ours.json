{"lyrics": "Elevator buttons and morning air\nStrangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs\nIf you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares\nBut right now my time is theirs\nSeems like there's always someone who disapproves\nThey'll judge it like they know about me and you\nAnd the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do\nThe jury's out, but my choice is you\nSo don't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nAnd life makes love look hard\nThe stakes are high, the water's rough\nBut this love is ours\nYou never know what people have up their sleeves\nGhosts from your past gonna jump out at me\nLurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles\nBut I don't care 'cause right now you're mine\nAnd you'll say\nDon't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nAnd life makes love look hard\nThe stakes are high, the water's rough\nBut this love is ours\nAnd it's not theirs to speculate\nIf it's wrong and\nYour hands are tough\nBut they are where mine belong and\nI'll fight their doubt and give you faith\nWith this song for you\n'Cause I love the gap between your teeth\nAnd I love the riddles that you speak\nAnd any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored\n'Cause my heart is yours\nSo don't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nAnd life makes love look hard\nDon't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nBut they can't take what's ours\nThey can't take what's ours\nThe stakes are high, the water's rough\nBut this love is ours", "title": "Ours", "album": "Speak Now", "year": "2010"}
