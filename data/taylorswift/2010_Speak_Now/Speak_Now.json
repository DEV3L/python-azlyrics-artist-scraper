"{'album': 'Speak Now', 'title': 'Speak Now', 'lyrics': '\"Speak Now\"\\nI am not the kind of girl\\nWho should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion\\nBut you are not the kind of boy\\nWho should be marrying the wrong girl\\nI sneak in and see your friends\\nAnd her snotty little family all dressed in pastel\\nAnd she is yelling at a bridesmaid\\nSomewhere back inside a room\\nWearing a gown shaped like a pastry\\nThis is surely not what you thought it would be\\nI lose myself in a daydream\\nWhere I stand and say\\n[Chorus:]\\nDon\u2019t say \"Yes\", run away now\\nI\u2019ll meet you when you\u2019re out of the church at the back door\\nDon\u2019t wait or say a single vow\\nYou need to hear me out\\nAnd they said, \"Speak now.\"\\nFond gestures are exchanged\\nAnd the organ starts to play\\nA song that sounds like a death march\\nAnd I am hiding in the curtains\\nIt seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be\\nShe floats down the aisle like a pageant queen\\nBut I know you wish it was me,\\nYou wish it was me,\\nDon\u2019t you?\\n[Chorus:]\\nDon\u2019t say \"Yes\", run away now,\\nI\u2019ll meet you when you\u2019re out of the church at the back door.\\nDon\u2019t wait or say a single vow,\\nYou need to hear me out,\\nAnd they said, \"Speak now.\"\\nDon\u2019t say \"Yes\", run away now,\\nI\u2019ll meet you when you\u2019re out of the church at the back door.\\nDon\u2019t wait or say a single vow,\\nYour time is running out,\\nAnd they said, \"Speak now.\"\\nOh, la, la\\nOh, oh\\nSay a single vow\\nI hear the preacher say, \"Speak now or forever hold your peace.\"\\nThere\u2019s the silence, there\u2019s my last chance.\\nI stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.\\nHorrified looks from everyone in the room\\nBut I\u2019m only looking at you.\\nI am not the kind of girl\\nWho should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion\\nBut you are not the kind of boy\\nWho should be marrying the wrong girl\\n[Chorus:]\\nSo, don\u2019t say \"Yes\", run away now,\\nI\u2019ll meet you when you\u2019re out of the church at the back door.\\nDon\u2019t wait or say a single vow,\\nYou need to hear me out,\\nAnd they said, \"Speak now.\"\\nAnd you say, \"Let\u2019s run away now,\\nI\u2019ll meet you when I\u2019m out of my tux at the back door.\\nBaby, I didn\u2019t say my vows,\\nSo glad you were around\\nWhen they said, \"Speak now.\"', 'year': '2010'}"
