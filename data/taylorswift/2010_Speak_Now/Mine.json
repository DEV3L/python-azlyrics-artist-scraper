{"lyrics": "Uh, oh, oh\nUh, oh, oh\nYou were in college working part time waiting tables\nLeft a small town, never looked back\nI was a flight risk with a fear of fallin\u2019\nWondering why we bother with love if it never lasts\nI say, \"Can you believe it?\"\nAs we\u2019re lying on the couch\nThe moment I can see it.\nYes, yes, I can see it now.\nDo you remember, we were sitting there by the water?\nYou put your arm around me for the first time.\nYou made a rebel of a careless man\u2019s careful daughter.\nYou are the best thing that\u2019s ever been mine.\nFlash forward and we\u2019re taking on the world together,\nAnd there\u2019s a drawer of my things at your place.\nYou learn my secrets and you figure out why I\u2019m guarded,\nYou say we\u2019ll never make my parents\u2019 mistakes.\nBut we got bills to pay,\nWe got nothing figured out,\nWhen it was hard to take,\nYes, yes, this is what I thought about.\nDo you remember, we were sitting there by the water?\nYou put your arm around me for the first time\nYou made a rebel of a careless man\u2019s careful daughter\nYou are the best thing that\u2019s ever been mine.\nDo you remember all the city lights on the water?\nYou saw me start to believe for the first time\nYou made a rebel of a careless man\u2019s careful daughter\nYou are the best thing that\u2019s ever been mine.\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nAnd I remember that fight\nTwo-thirty AM\nAs everything was slipping right out of our hands\nI ran out crying and you followed me out into the street\nBraced myself for the \"Goodbye.\"\n\u2018Cause that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known\nThen you took me by surprise\nYou said, \"I\u2019ll never leave you alone.\"\nYou said, \"I remember how we felt sitting by the water.\nAnd every time I look at you, it\u2019s like the first time.\nI fell in love with a careless man\u2019s careful daughter.\nShe is the best thing that\u2019s ever been mine.\"\nHold on, make it last\nHold on, never turn back\nYou made a rebel of a careless man\u2019s careful daughter\nYou are the best thing that\u2019s ever been mine.\n(Hold on) do you believe it?\n(Hold on) we're gonna make it now.\n(Hold on) and I can see it,\n(Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now...)", "title": "Mine", "album": "Speak Now", "year": "2010"}
