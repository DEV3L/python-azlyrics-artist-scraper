  "lyrics": "Long were the nights\nWhen my days once revolved around you\nCounting my footsteps\nPraying the floor won't fall through\nAgain\nAnd my mother accused me of losing my mind\nBut I swore I was fine\nYou paint me a blue sky\nAnd go back and turn it to rain\nAnd I lived in your chess game\nBut you changed the rules every day\nWonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone tonight.\nWell, I stopped pickin' up, and this song is to let you know why.\nDear John,\nI see it all now that you're gone.\nDon't you think I was too young to be messed\nWith?\nThe girl in the dress\nCried the whole way home.\nI should've known.\nWell, maybe it's me\nAnd my blind optimism\nTo blame.\nOr maybe it's you and your sick need\nTo give love then take it away.\nAnd you'll add my name\nTo your long list of traitors\nWho don't understand.\nAnd I look back in regret.\nHow I ignored when they said,\n\"Run as fast as you can.\"\nDear John,\nI see it all now that you're gone.\nDon't you think I was too young to be messed\nWith?\nThe girl in the dress\nCried the whole way home.\nDear John,\nI see it all now. It was wrong.\nDon't you think nineteen's too young to be played\nBy your dark twisted games?\nWhen I loved you so.\nI should've known.\nYou are an expert at \"Sorry\"\nAnd keeping lines blurry.\nNever impressed by me acing your tests.\nAll the girls that you've run dry\nHave tired lifeless eyes\n'Cause you've burned them out.\nBut I took your matches\nBefore fire could catch me.\nSo, don't look now.\nI'm shining like fireworks\nOver your sad empty town.\nDear John,\nI see it all now that you're gone.\nDon't you think I was too young to be messed\nWith?\nThe girl in the dress\nCried the whole way home.\nI see it all now that you're gone\nDon't you think I was too young to be messed\nWith?\nThe girl in the dress\nWrote you a song.\nYou should've known.\nYou should've known.\nDon't you think I was too young?\nYou should've known.",
