{"lyrics": "Last night I heard my own heart beating\nSounded like footsteps on my stairs\nSix months gone and I'm still reaching\nEven though I know you're not there\nI was playing back a thousand memories, baby\nThinking 'bout everything we've been through\nMaybe I've been going back too much lately\nWhen time stood still and I had you\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou would, you would if this was a movie\nStand in the rain outside 'til I came out\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou could, you could if you just said you're sorry\nI know that we could work it out somehow\nBut if this was a movie you'd be here by now\nI know people change and these things happen\nBut I remember how it was back then\nLocked up in your arms and our friends are laughing\n'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,\nNow I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street\nFlashback to the night when you said to me,\n\"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you,\nNot before I knew how much I had to lose.\"\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou would, you would if this was a movie\nStand in the rain outside 'til I came out\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou could, you could if you just said you're sorry\nI know that we could work it out somehow\nBut if this was a movie you'd be here by now\nIf you're out there,\nIf you're somewhere,\nIf you're moving on,\nI've been waiting for you.\nEver since you've been gone\nI just want it back the way it was before.\nAnd I just wanna see you back at my front door.\nAnd I'd say\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou would before you said, \"It's not that easy.\"\nBefore the fight, before I locked you out\nBut I take it all back now\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou would, you would if this was a movie\nStand in the rain outside 'til I came out\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou could, you could if you just said you're sorry\nI know that we could work it out somehow\nBut if this was a movie you'd be here by now\nYou'd be here by now\nIt's not the kind of ending you wanna see now\nBaby, what about the ending\nOh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa\nThought you'd be here by now", "title": "If This Was A Movie", "album": "Speak Now", "year": "2010"}
