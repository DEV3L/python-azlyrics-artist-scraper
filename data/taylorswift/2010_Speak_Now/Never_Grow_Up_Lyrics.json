  "lyrics": "Your little hand's wrapped around my finger\nAnd it's so quiet in the world tonight\nYour little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming\nSo I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light\nTo you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret\nI'd give all I have, honey\nIf you could stay like that\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, just stay this little\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple\nI won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart\nAnd no one will desert you\nJust try to never grow up, never grow up\nYou're in the car on the way to the movies\nAnd you're mortified your mom's dropping you off\nAt 14 there's just so much you can't do\nAnd you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots\nBut don't make her drop you off around the block\nRemember that she's getting older too\nAnd don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, just stay this little\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple\nNo one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred\nAnd even though you want to, just try to never grow up\nTake pictures in your mind of your childhood room\nMemorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home\nRemember the footsteps, remember the words said\nAnd all your little brother's favorite songs\nI just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone\nSo here I am in my new apartment\nIn a big city, they just dropped me off\nIt's so much colder than I thought it would be\nSo I tuck myself in and turn my night light on\nWish I'd never grown up\nI wish I'd never grown up\nOh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up\nI could still be little\nOh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up\nIt could still be simple\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, just stay this little\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple\nWon't let nobody hurt you\nWon't let no one break your heart\nAnd even though you want to, please try to never grow up\nOh, don't you ever grow up\nOh, never grow up, just never grow up",
