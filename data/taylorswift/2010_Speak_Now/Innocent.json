"{'album': 'Speak Now', 'title': 'Innocent', 'lyrics': '\"Innocent\"\\nI guess you really did it this time\\nLeft yourself in your warpath\\nLost your balance on a tightrope\\nLost your mind tryin\\' to get it back\\nWasn\\'t it easier in your lunchbox days?\\nAlways a bigger bed to crawl into\\nWasn\\'t it beautiful when you believed in everything\\nAnd everybody believed in you?\\nIt\\'s alright, just wait and see\\nYour string of lights is still bright to me\\nOh, who you are is not where you\\'ve been.\\nYou\\'re still an innocent,\\nYou\\'re still an innocent.\\nDid some things you can\\'t speak of\\nBut at night you live it all again\\nYou wouldn\\'t be shattered on the floor now\\nIf only you had seen what you know now then\\nWasn\\'t it easier in your firefly-catchin\\' days?\\nWhen everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you\\nWasn\\'t it beautiful runnin\\' wild \\'til you fell asleep\\nBefore the monsters caught up to you?\\nIt\\'s alright, just wait and see\\nYour string of lights is still bright to me\\nOh, who you are is not what you\\'ve been\\nYou\\'re still an innocent\\nIt\\'s okay, life is a tough crowd\\n32, and still growin\\' up now\\nWho you are is not what you did.\\nYou\\'re still an innocent.\\nTime turns flames to embers\\nYou\\'ll have new Septembers\\nEvery one of us has messed up too\\nMinds change like the weather\\nI hope you remember\\nToday is never too late to be brand new\\nIt\\'s alright, just wait and see\\nYour string of lights is still bright to me\\nOh, who you are is not what you\\'ve been\\nYou\\'re still an innocent.\\nIt\\'s okay, life is a tough crowd\\n32, and still growin\\' up now\\nWho you are is not what you did\\nYou\\'re still an innocent.\\nYou\\'re still an innocent.\\nLost your balance on a tightrope.\\nIt\\'s never too late to get it back.', 'year': '2010'}"
