"{'album': 'Speak Now', 'title': 'Mean', 'lyrics': '\"Mean\"\\nYou, with your words like knives\\nAnd swords and weapons that you use against me\\nYou have knocked me off my feet again\\nGot me feeling like a nothing\\nYou, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard\\nCalling me out when I\\'m wounded\\nYou, picking on the weaker man\\nWell you can take me down with just one single blow\\nBut you don\\'t know, what you don\\'t know...\\nSomeday I\\'ll be living in a big ole city\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\nSomeday I\\'ll be big enough so you can\\'t hit me\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\\nYou, with your switching sides\\nAnd your wildfire lies and your humiliation\\nYou have pointed out my flaws again\\nAs if I don\\'t already see them\\nI walk with my head down\\nTrying to block you out \\'cause I\\'ll never impress you\\nI just wanna feel okay again\\nI bet you got pushed around\\nSomebody made you cold\\nBut the cycle ends right now\\n\\'Cause you can\\'t lead me down that road\\nAnd you don\\'t know, what you don\\'t know...\\nSomeday I\\'ll be living in a big ole city\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\nSomeday I\\'ll be big enough so you can\\'t hit me\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\\nAnd I can see you years from now in a bar\\nTalking over a football game\\nWith that same big loud opinion\\nBut nobody\\'s listening\\nWashed up and ranting about the same old bitter things\\nDrunk and grumbling on about how I can\\'t sing\\nBut all you are is mean\\nAll you are is mean\\nAnd a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life\\nAnd mean, and mean, and mean, and mean\\nBut someday I\\'ll be living in a big ole city\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean, yeah\\nSomeday I\\'ll be big enough so you can\\'t hit me\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\nWhy you gotta be so?...\\nSomeday I\\'ll be living in a big ole city (Why you gotta be so?...)\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...)\\nSomeday I\\'ll be big enough so you can\\'t hit me (Why you gotta be so?...)\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\nWhy you gotta be so mean?', 'year': '2010'}"
