{"lyrics": "\"Haunted\"\nYou and I walk a fragile line\nI have known it all this time\nBut I never thought I'd live to see it break\nIt's getting dark and it's all too quiet\nAnd I can't trust anything now\nAnd it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake\nOh, I'm holding my breath\nWon't lose you again\nSomething's made your eyes go cold\nCome on, come on, don't leave me like this\nI thought I had you figured out\nSomething's gone terribly wrong\nYou're all I wanted\nCome on, come on, don't leave me like this\nI thought I had you figured out\nCan't breathe whenever you're gone\nCan't turn back now, I'm haunted\nStood there and watched you walk away\nFrom everything we had\nBut I still mean every word I said to you\nHe will try to take away my pain\nAnd he just might make me smile\nBut the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead\nOh, I'm holding my breath\nWon't see you again\nSomething keeps me holding on to nothing\nCome on, come on, don't leave me like this\nI thought I had you figured out\nSomething's gone terribly wrong\nYou're all I wanted\nCome on, come on, don't leave me like this\nI thought I had you figured out\nCan't breathe whenever you're gone\nCan't turn back now, I'm haunted\nI know, I know, I just know\nYou're not gone. You can't be gone. No.\nCome on, come on, don't leave me like this\nI thought I had you figured out\nSomething's gone terribly wrong\nWon't finish what you started\nCome on, come on, don't leave me like this\nI thought I had you figured out\nCan't breathe whenever you're gone\nCan't go back, I'm haunted\nOh\nYou and I walk a fragile line\nI have known it all this time\nNever ever thought I'd see it break.\nNever thought I'd see it...", "title": "Haunted", "year": "2010", "album": "Speak Now"}
