{"lyrics": "\"Stay Stay Stay\"\nI'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.\nI threw my phone across the room at you.\nI was expecting some dramatic turn-away,\nBut you stayed.\nThis morning I said we should talk about it.\n'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved.\nThat's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, \"Okay, let's talk.\"\nAnd I said,\nStay, stay, stay.\nI've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.\nYou think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.\nBut I think that it's best if we both stay.\nBefore you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers,\nWho took all of their problems out on me.\nBut you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'.\nAnd I love you because you have given me no choice but to...\nStay, stay, stay.\nI've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.\nYou think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.\nBut I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.\nYou took the time to memorize me:\nMy fears, my hopes, and dreams.\nI just like hangin' out with you all the time.\nAll those times that you didn't leave;\nIt's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life.\nStay.\nAnd I'll be loving you for quite some time.\nNo one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad.\nSo I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.\nStay, stay, stay.\nI've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.\nYou think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.\nBut I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.\nStay, stay, stay.\nI've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.\nYou think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.\nBut I think that it's best if we both stay.\n[Background:] That's so fun!", "title": "Stay Stay Stay", "year": "2012", "album": "Red"}
