{"lyrics": "\"The Moment I Knew\"\nYou should've been there,\nShould've burst through the door,\nWith that 'baby I'm right here' smile,\nAnd it would've felt like,\nA million little shining stars had just aligned,\nAnd I would've been so happy.\nChristmas lights glisten,\nI've got my eye on the door,\nJust waiting for you to walk in,\nBut the time is ticking,\nPeople ask me how I've been\nAs I comb back through my memory,\nHow you said you'd be here,\nYou said you'd be here.\nAnd it was like slow motion,\nStanding there in my party dress,\nIn red lipstick,\nWith no one to impress,\nAnd they're all laughing,\nAs I'm looking around the room,\nBut there's one thing missing,\nAnd that was the moment I knew.\nAnd the hours pass by,\nNow I just wanna be alone,\nBut your close friends always seem to know\nWhen there's something really wrong,\nSo they follow me down the hall,\nAnd there in the bathroom,\nI try not to fall apart,\nAnd the sinking feeling starts,\nAs I say hopelessly,\n\"He said he'd be here.\"\nAnd it was like slow motion,\nStanding there in my party dress,\nIn red lipstick,\nWith no one to impress,\nAnd they're all laughing,\nAnd asking me about you,\nBut there was one thing missing,\nAnd that was the moment I knew.\nWhat do you say\nWhen tears are streaming down your face\nIn front of everyone you know?\nAnd what do you do when the one\nWho means the most to you\nIs the one who didn't show?\nYou should've been here.\nAnd I would've been so happy.\nAnd it was like slow motion,\nStanding there in my party dress,\nIn red lipstick,\nWith no one to impress,\nAnd they're all standing around me singing\n\"Happy birthday to you\",\nBut there was one thing missing,\nAnd that was the moment I knew.\nOoh, I knew.\nOoh,\nYou called me later,\nAnd said, \"I'm sorry, I didn't make it,\"\nAnd I said, \"I'm sorry too,\"\nAnd that was the moment I knew.", "title": "The Moment I Knew", "year": "2012", "album": "Red"}
