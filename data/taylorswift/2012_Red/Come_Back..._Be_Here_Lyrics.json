  "lyrics": "You said it in a simple way,\n4 AM, the second day,\nHow strange that I don't know you at all.\nStumbled through the long goodbye,\nOne last kiss, then catch your flight,\nRight when I was just about to fall\nI told myself, \"Don't get attached,\"\nBut in my mind I play it back,\nSpinning faster than the plane that took you...\nAnd this is when the feeling sinks in,\nI don't wanna miss you like this,\nCome back... be here, come back... be here.\nI guess you're in New York today,\nI don't wanna need you this way,\nCome back... be here, come back... be here.\nThe delicate beginning rush,\nThe feeling you can know so much,\nWithout knowing anything at all.\nAnd now that I can't put this down,\nIf I had known what I'd known now,\nI never would have played so nonchalant.\nTaxi cabs and busy streets,\nThat never bring you back to me,\nI can't help but wish you took me with you...\nAnd this is when the feeling sinks in,\nI don't wanna miss you like this,\nCome back... be here, come back... be here.\nI guess you're in London today,\nI don't wanna need you this way,\nCome back... be here, come back... be here.\nThis is falling in love in the cruelest way,\nThis is falling for you when you are worlds away.\nNew York... be here.\nBut you're in London and I break down,\n'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.\nThis is when the feeling sinks in,\nI don't wanna miss you like this,\nCome back... be here, come back... be here.\nI guess you're in New York today,\nAnd I don't wanna need you this way,\nCome back... be here, come back... be here.\nI don't wanna miss you like this.\nCome back... be here.\nCome back... be here.",
