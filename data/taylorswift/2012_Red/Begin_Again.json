{"lyrics": "Took a deep breath in the mirror\nHe didn't like it when I wore high heels\nBut I do\nTurn the lock and put my headphones on\nHe always said he didn't get this song\nBut I do, I do\nWalked in expecting you'd be late\nBut you got here early and you stand and wave\nI walk to you\nYou pull my chair out and help me in\nAnd you don't know how nice that is\nBut I do\nAnd you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\nI think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did\nI've been spending the last eight months\nThinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again\nYou said you never met one girl\nWho had as many James Taylor records as you\nBut I do\nWe tell stories and you don't know why\nI'm coming off a little shy\nBut I do\nBut you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\nI think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did\nI've been spending the last eight months\nThinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again\nAnd we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up\nBut you start to talk about the movies that your family\nWatches\nEvery single Christmas and I want to talk about that\nAnd for the first time what's past is past\n'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\nI think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did\nI've been spending the last eight months\nThinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again", "title": "Begin Again", "album": "Red", "year": "2012"}
