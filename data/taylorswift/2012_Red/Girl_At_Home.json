{"lyrics": "\"Girl At Home\"\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nUh, uh\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that.\nI don't even know her,\nBut I feel a responsibility,\nTo do what's upstanding and right,\nIt's kinda like a code, yeah,\nAnd you've been getting closer and closer,\nAnd crossing so many lines.\nAnd it would be a fine proposition,\nIf I was a stupid girl,\nBut honey I am no-one's exception,\nThis I have previously learned.\nSo don't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nUh, uh\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nI see you turn off your phone,\nAnd now you got me alone,\nAnd I say,\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that.\nI just wanna make sure,\nYou understand perfectly,\nYou're the kind of man who makes me sad,\nWhile she waits up,\nYou chase down the newest thing,\nAnd take for granted what you have.\nAnd it would be a fine proposition,\nIf I was a stupid girl,\nAnd yeah I might go with it,\nIf I hadn't once been just like her.\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nUh, uh\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nI see you turn off your phone,\nAnd now you've got me alone,\nAnd I say,\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that.\nCall a cab,\nLose my number,\nYou're about to lose your girl,\nCall a cab,\nLose my number,\nLet's consider this lesson learned.\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nUh, uh\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nWanna see you pick up your phone,\nAnd tell her you're coming home,\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that,\nUh, uh\nDon't look at me,\nYou've got a girl at home,\nAnd everybody knows that,\nEverybody knows that.\nIt would be a fine proposition,\nIf I hadn't once been just like her.", "title": "Girl At Home", "year": "2012", "album": "Red"}
