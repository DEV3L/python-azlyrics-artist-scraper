{"lyrics": "Put your lips close to mine\nAs long as they don't touch\nOut of focus, eye to eye\nTill the gravity's too much\nAnd I'll do anything you say\nIf you say it with your hands\nAnd I'd be smart to walk away,\nBut you're quicksand\nThis slope is treacherous\nThis path is reckless\nThis slope is treacherous\nAnd I, I, I like it\nI can't decide if it's a choice\nGetting swept away\nI hear the sound of my own voice\nAsking you to stay\nAnd all we are is skin and bone\nTrained to get along\nForever going with the flow,\nBut you're friction\nThis slope is treacherous\nThis path is reckless\nThis slope is treacherous\nAnd I, I, I like it\nTwo headlights shine through the sleepless night\nAnd I will get you, and get you alone\nYour name has echoed through my mind\nAnd I just think you should, think you should know\nThat nothing safe is worth the drive and I would\nFollow you, follow you home...\nI'll follow you, follow you home...\nThis hope is treacherous\nThis daydream is dangerous\nThis hope is treacherous\nI, I, I... I, I, I... I, I, I...\nTwo headlights shine through the sleepless night\nAnd I will get you, and get you alone\nYour name has echoed through my mind\nAnd I just think you should, think you should know\nThat nothing safe is worth the drive and I will\nFollow you, follow you home...\nI'll follow you, follow you home...\nI'll follow you, follow you home...\nI'll follow you, follow you home...\nThis slope is treacherous\nI, I, I like it", "title": "Treacherous", "album": "Red", "year": "2012"}
