  "lyrics": "New to town with a made up name in the angel's city,\nChasing fortune and fame.\nAnd the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.\nYou had it figured out since you were in school.\nEverybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.\nSo overnight you look like a sixties\u2019 queen.\nAnother name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.\nAnd they\u2019ll tell you now, you\u2019re the lucky one.\nYeah, they\u2019ll tell you now, you\u2019re the lucky one.\nBut can you tell me now, you\u2019re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh...\nNow it\u2019s big black cars, and Riviera views,\nAnd your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you\nAnd your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.\nAnd they tell you that you\u2019re lucky.\nBut you\u2019re so confused,\n'Cause you don\u2019t feel pretty, you just feel used.\nAnd all the young things line up to take your place.\nAnother name goes up in lights. You wonder if you\u2019ll make it out alive.\nAnd they\u2019ll tell you now, you\u2019re the lucky one.\nYeah, they\u2019ll tell you now, you\u2019re the lucky one.\nCan you tell me now, you\u2019re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.\nIt was a few years later, I showed up here.\nAnd they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,\nHow you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.\nThey say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,\nChose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,\nAnd it took some time, but I understand it now.\n\u2018Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,\nLet me tell you now, you\u2019re the lucky one.\nLet me tell you now, you\u2019re the lucky one.\nLet me tell you now, you\u2019re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.\nYeah they\u2019ll tell you now, you\u2019re the lucky one.\nYeah, they\u2019ll tell you now, you\u2019re the lucky one.\nAnd they\u2019ll tell you now, you\u2019re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.\nOh, whoa, oh, oh",
