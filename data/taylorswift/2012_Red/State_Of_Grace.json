"{'album': 'Red', 'title': 'State Of Grace', 'lyrics': '\"State Of Grace\"\\nI\\'m walking fast through the traffic lights\\nBusy streets and busy lives\\nAnd all we know\\nIs touch and go\\nWe are alone with our changing minds\\nWe fall in love \\'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time\\nAnd I never (never) saw you coming\\nAnd I\\'ll never (never) be the same\\nYou come around and the armor falls\\nPierce the room like a cannonball\\nNow all we know is don\\'t let go\\nWe are alone, just you and me\\nUp in your room and our slates are clean\\nJust twin fire signs\\nFour blue eyes\\nSo you were never a saint\\nAnd I\u2019ve loved in shades of wrong\\nWe learn to live with the pain\\nMosaic broken hearts\\nBut this love is brave and wild\\nAnd I never (never) {[x8:] Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming\\nAnd I\\'ll never (never) be the same\\nThis is a state of grace\\nThis is the worthwhile fight\\nLove is a ruthless game\\nUnless you play it good and right\\nThese are the hands of fate\\nYou\\'re my Achilles heel\\nThis is the golden age of something good and right and real\\nAnd I never (never) saw you coming\\nAnd I\\'ll never (never) be the same\\nAnd I never (never) {[x8:] Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming\\nAnd I\\'ll never (never) be the same\\nThis is a state of grace\\nThis is the worthwhile fight\\nLove is a ruthless game\\nUnless you play it good and right', 'year': '2012'}"
