{"lyrics": "[Music video spoken part:]\nI think--I think when it's all over,\nIt just comes back in flashes, you know?\nIt's like a kaleidoscope of memories.\nIt just all comes back. But he never does.\nI think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.\nIt's not really anything he said or anything he did,\nIt was the feeling that came along with it.\nAnd the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.\nBut I don't know if I should.\nI knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.\nBut I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?\nMaybe he knew that when he saw me.\nI guess I just lost my balance.\nI think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.\nIt was losing me.\nOnce upon a time a few mistakes ago\nI was in your sights, you got me alone\nYou found me, you found me, you found me\nI guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that\nAnd when I fell hard you took a step back\nWithout me, without me, without me\nAnd he's long gone when he's next to me\nAnd I realize the blame is on me\n'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in\nSo shame on me now\nFlew me to places I'd never been\n'Til you put me down, oh\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\nSo shame on me now\nFlew me to places I'd never been\nNow I'm lying on the cold hard ground\nOh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble\nOh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble\nNo apologies. He'll never see you cry,\nPretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why.\nYou're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning.\nNow I heard you moved on from whispers on the street\nA new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be\nAnd now I see, now I see, now I see\nHe was long gone when he met me\nAnd I realize the joke is on me, yeah!\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\nSo shame on me now\nFlew me to places I'd never been\n'Til you put me down, oh\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\nSo shame on me now\nFlew me to places I'd never been\nNow I'm lying on the cold hard ground\nOh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble\nOh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble\nAnd the saddest fear comes creeping in\nThat you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\nSo shame on me now\nFlew me to places I'd never been\n'Til you put me down, oh\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)\nSo shame on me now\nFlew me to places I'd never been\nNow I'm lying on the cold hard ground\nOh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble\nOh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\nTrouble, trouble, trouble\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\nTrouble, trouble, trouble\n[Music video spoken part:]\nI don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.", "title": "I Knew You Were Trouble", "album": "Red", "year": "2012"}
