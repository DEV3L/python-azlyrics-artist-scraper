{"lyrics": "I was reminiscing just the other day,\nWhile having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.\nBack to a first-glance feeling on New York Time.\nBack when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.\nTook off faster than a green light \"Go\".\nYeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know.\nI left a note on the door with a joke we\u2019d made,\nAnd that was the first day.\nAnd darling, it was good never looking down.\nAnd right there where we stood was holy ground.\nSpinning like a girl in a brand new dress,\nWe had this big wide city all to ourselves.\nWe blocked the noise with the sound of \u2018I need you\u2019,\nAnd for the first time I had something to lose,\nAnd I guess we fell apart in the usual way.\nAnd the story\u2019s got dust on every page,\nBut sometimes I wonder how you think about it now.\nAnd I see your face in every crowd.\nCause darling, it was good never looking down.\nAnd right there where we stood was holy ground.\nTonight I\u2019m gonna dance for all that we\u2019ve been through.\nBut I don\u2019t wanna dance if I\u2019m not dancing with you.\nTonight I\u2019m gonna dance like you were in this room.\nBut I don\u2019t wanna dance if I\u2019m not dancing with you,\nIt was good never looking down.\nAnd right there where we stood was holy ground.\nTonight I\u2019m gonna dance for all that we\u2019ve been through.\nBut I don\u2019t wanna dance if I\u2019m not dancing with you.\nTonight I\u2019m gonna dance like you were in this room.\nBut I don\u2019t wanna dance if I\u2019m not dancing with you.", "title": "Holy Ground", "album": "Red", "year": "2012"}
