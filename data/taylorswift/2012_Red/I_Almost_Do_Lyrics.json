  "lyrics": "I bet this time of night you're still up.\nI bet you're tired from a long hard week.\nI bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.\nAnd I bet sometimes you wonder about me.\nAnd I just wanna tell you\nIt takes everything in me not to call you.\nAnd I wish I could run to you.\nAnd I hope you know that every time I don't\nI almost do,\nI almost do.\nI bet you think I either moved on or hate you\n'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply.\nI bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say \"Hello\" to you\nAnd risk another goodbye.\nAnd I just wanna tell you\nIt takes everything in me not to call you.\nAnd I wish I could run to you.\nAnd I hope you know that every time I don't\nI almost do,\nI almost do.\nOh, we made quite a mess, babe.\nIt's probably better off this way.\nAnd I confess, babe,\nIn my dreams you're touching my face\nAnd asking me if I wanna try again with you.\nAnd I almost do.\nAnd I just wanna tell you\nIt takes everything in me not to call you.\nAnd I wish I could run to you.\nAnd I hope you know that every time I don't\nI almost do,\nI almost do.\nI bet this time of night you're still up.\nI bet you're tired from a long hard week.\nI bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.\nAnd I hope sometimes you wonder about me.",
