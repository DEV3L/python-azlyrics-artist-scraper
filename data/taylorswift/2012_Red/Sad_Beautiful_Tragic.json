{"lyrics": "Long handwritten note deep in your pocket\nWords, how little they mean when you're a little too late\nI stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket\nGood girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait\nWe had a beautiful magic love there\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\nIn dreams I meet you in warm conversation\nWe both wake in lonely beds in different cities\nAnd time is taking its sweet time erasing you\nAnd you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me\n'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\nDistance, timing, breakdown, fighting\nSilence, this train runs off its tracks\nKiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?\nHang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back\nA beautiful magic love there\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful\nWhat we had \u2013 a beautiful magic love there\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\nWe had a beautiful magic love there\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair", "title": "Sad Beautiful Tragic", "album": "Red", "year": "2012"}
