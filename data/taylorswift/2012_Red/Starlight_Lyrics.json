  "lyrics": "I said, \"Oh my, what a marvelous tune\"\nIt was the best night, never would forget how we moved.\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines,\nAnd we were dancing, dancing\nLike we're made of starlight\nLike we're made of starlight\nI met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45\nPicked me up late one night out the window,\nWe were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild\nCan't remember what song it was playing when we walked in\nThe night we snuck into a yacht club party\nPretending to be a duchess and a prince\nAnd I said, \"Oh my, what a marvelous tune.\"\nIt was the best night, never would forget how we moved.\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines,\nAnd we were dancing, dancing\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nHe said, \"Look at you: worrying too much about things you can't change.\nYou'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way.\"\nHe was tryna skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,\n\"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?\nDon't you dream impossible things?\"\nLike \"Oh my, what a marvelous tune.\"\nIt was the best night, never would forget how we moved\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines,\nAnd we were dancing, dancing\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nOoh, ooh, he's talking crazy\nOoh, ooh, dancing with me\nOoh, ooh, we could get married\nHave ten kids and teach them how to dream\nOh my, what a marvelous tune\nIt was the best night, never would forget how we moved\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines,\nAnd we were dancing, dancing\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nLike we dream impossible dreams\nLike starlight, starlight\nLike we dream impossible dreams\nDon't you see the starlight, starlight?\nDon't you dream impossible things?",
