{"lyrics": "(feat. Gary Lightbody)\n[Gary Lightbody:]\nI find myself at your door,\nJust like all those times before,\nI'm not sure how I got there,\nAll roads\u2014they lead me here.\nI imagine you are home,\nIn your room, all alone,\nAnd you open your eyes into mine,\nAnd everything feels better,\n[Both:]\nand right before your eyes,\nI'm breaking, no past\nNo reasons why,\nJust you and me.\nThis is the last time I'm asking you this,\nPut my name at the top of your list,\nThis is the last time I'm asking you why,\nYou break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.\n[Taylor Swift:]\nYou find yourself at my door,\nJust like all those times before,\nYou wear your best apology,\nBut I was there to watch you leave,\nAnd all the times I let you in,\nJust for you to go again,\nDisappear when you come back,\nEverything is better.\n[Both:]\nand right before your eyes,\nI'm aching, no past\nNowhere to hide,\nJust you and me...\nThis is the last time I'm asking you this,\nPut my name at the top of your list,\nThis is the last time I'm asking you why,\nYou break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye...\n[Taylor Swift:] This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong,\n[Gary Lightbody:] This is the last time I say it's been you all along,\n[Taylor Swift:] This is the last time I let you in my door,\n[Gary Lightbody:] This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore.\nOh, oh, oh,\nThis is the last time I'm asking you this,\nPut my name at the top of your list,\nThis is the last time I'm asking you why,\nYou break my heart in the blink of an eye.\n[4x:]\nThis is the last time I'm asking you,\nLast time I'm asking you,\nLast time I'm asking you this...", "title": "The Last Time", "album": "Red", "year": "2012"}
