  "lyrics": "He is sensible and so incredible\nAnd all my single friends are jealous\nHe says everything I need to hear and it's like\nI couldn't ask for anything better\nHe opens up my door and I get into his car\nAnd he says you look beautiful tonight\nAnd I feel perfectly fine\nBut I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain\nAnd it's 2am and I'm cursing your name\nYou're so in love that you act insane\nAnd that's the way I loved you\nBreakin' down and coming undone\nIt's a roller coaster kinda rush\nAnd I never knew I could feel that much\nAnd that's the way I loved you\nHe respects my space\nAnd never makes me wait\nAnd he calls exactly when he says he will\nHe's close to my mother\nTalks business with my father\nHe's charming and endearing\nAnd I'm comfortable\nBut I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain\nAnd it's 2am and I'm cursing your name\nYou're so in love that you act insane\nAnd that's the way I loved you\nBreakin' down and coming undone\nIt's a roller coaster kinda rush\nAnd I never knew I could feel that much\nAnd that's the way I loved you\nHe can't see the smile I'm faking\nAnd my heart's not breaking\nCause I'm not feeling anything at all\nAnd you were wild and crazy\nJust so frustrating intoxicating\nComplicated, got away by some mistake and now\nI miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain\nIt's 2am and I'm cursing your name\nI'm so in love that I acted insane\nAnd that's the way I loved you\nBreaking down and coming undone\nIt's a roller coaster kinda rush\nAnd I never knew I could feel that much\nAnd that's the way I loved you oh, oh\nAnd that's the way I loved you oh, oh\nNever knew I could feel that much\nAnd that's the way I loved you",
