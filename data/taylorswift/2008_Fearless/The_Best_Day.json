{"lyrics": "\"The Best Day\"\nI'm five years old\r\nIt's getting cold\r\nI've got my big coat on\nI hear your laugh\r\nAnd look up smiling at you\r\nI run and run\nPast the pumpkin patch\r\nAnd the tractor rides\r\nLook now -- the sky is gold\r\nI hug your legs and fall asleep\r\nOn the way home\nI don't know why all the trees change in the fall\r\nI know you're not scared of anything at all\r\nDon't know if Snow White's house is near or far away\r\nBut I know I had the best day\r\nWith you today\nI'm thirteen now\r\nAnd don't know how my friends\r\nCould be so mean\nI come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys\nAnd we drive and drive\r\nUntil we've found a town\r\nFar enough away\nAnd we talk and window-shop\r\nUntil I've forgotten all their names\nI don't know who I'm gonna talk to\r\nNow at school\r\nI know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you\r\nDon't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay\r\nBut I know I had the best day\r\nWith you today\nI have an excellent father\r\nHis strength is making me stronger\r\nGod smiles on my little brother\r\nInside and out\r\nHe's better than I am\nI grew up in a pretty house\r\nAnd I had space to run\r\nAnd I had the best days with you\nThere is a video\r\nI found from back when I was three\r\nYou set up a paint set in the kitchen\r\nAnd you're talking to me\nIt's the age of princesses and pirate ships\r\nAnd the seven dwarfs\r\nDaddy's smart\r\nAnd you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world\nNow I know why all the trees change in the fall\r\nI know you were on my side\r\nEven when I was wrong\r\nAnd I love you for giving me your eyes\r\nStaying back and watching me shine\nAnd I didn't know if you knew\r\nSo I'm taking this chance to say\r\nThat I had the best day\r\nWith you today", "title": "The Best Day", "year": "2008", "album": "Fearless"}
