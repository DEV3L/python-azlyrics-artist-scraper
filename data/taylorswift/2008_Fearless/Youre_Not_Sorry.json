"{'album': 'Fearless', 'title': \"You're Not Sorry\", 'lyrics': '\"You\\'re Not Sorry\"\\nAll this time I was wasting,\\nHoping you would come around\\nI\\'ve been giving out chances every time\\nAnd all you do is let me down\\nAnd it\\'s taken me this long\\nBaby but I figured you out\\nAnd you\\'re thinking we\\'ll be fine again,\\nBut not this time around\\nYou don\\'t have to call anymore\\nI won\\'t pick up the phone\\nThis is the last straw\\nDon\\'t wanna hurt anymore\\nAnd you can tell me that you\\'re sorry\\nBut I don\\'t believe you baby\\nLike I did before\\nYou\\'re not sorry, no no oh\\nLooking so innocent,\\nI might believe you if I didn\\'t know\\nCould\\'ve loved you all my life\\nIf you hadn\\'t left me waiting in the cold\\nAnd you got your share of secrets\\nAnd I\\'m tired of being last to know\\nAnd now you\\'re asking me to listen\\nCause it\\'s worked each time before\\nBut you don\\'t have to call anymore\\nI won\\'t pick up the phone\\nThis is the last straw\\nDon\\'t wanna hurt anymore\\nAnd you can tell me that you\\'re sorry\\nBut I don\\'t believe you baby\\nLike I did before\\nYou\\'re not sorry, no no, oh\\nYou\\'re not sorry no no oh\\nYou had me crying for you honey\\nAnd it never would\\'ve gone away, no\\nYou used to shine so bright\\nBut I watched all of it fade\\nSo you don\\'t have to call anymore\\nI won\\'t pick up the phone\\nThis is the last straw\\nThere\\'s nothing left to beg for\\nAnd you can tell me that you\\'re sorry\\nBut I don\\'t believe you baby\\nLike I did before\\nYou\\'re not sorry, no no oh\\nYou\\'re not sorry, no no oh', 'year': '2008'}"
