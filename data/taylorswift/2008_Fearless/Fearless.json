{"lyrics": "There's somethin' 'bout the way\nThe street looks when it's just rained\nThere's a glow off the pavement\nYou walk me to the car\nAnd you know I wanna ask you to dance right there\nIn the middle of the parking lot\nYeah\nOh yeah\nWe're drivin' down the road\nI wonder if you know\nI'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now\nBut you're just so cool\nRun your hands through your hair\nAbsent-mindedly makin' me want you\nAnd I don't know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first\nFearless\nAnd I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress\nFearless\nSo, baby, drive slow\n'Til we run out of road in this one horse town\nI wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat\nYou put your eyes on me\nIn this moment now capture it, remember it\n'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first\nFearless\nAnd I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress\nFearless\nWell, you stood there with me in the doorway\nMy hands shake\nI'm not usually this way\nBut you pull me in and I'm a little more brave\nIt's the first kiss,\nIt's flawless,\nReally something,\nIt's fearless.\nOh yeah\n'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first\nFearless\nAnd I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress\nFearless\n'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first\nFearless\nAnd I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress\nFearless\nOh-oh\nOh yeah", "title": "Fearless", "album": "Fearless", "year": "2008"}
