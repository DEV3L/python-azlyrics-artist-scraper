{"lyrics": "I took a chance, I took a shot \r\nAnd you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not \r\nYou took a swing, I took it hard \r\nAnd down here from the ground I see who you are \nI'm sick and tired of your attitude \r\nI'm feeling like I don't know you \r\nYou tell me that you love me then you cut me down \r\nAnd I need you like a heartbeat \r\nBut you know you got a mean streak \r\nMakes me run for cover when you're around \r\nAnd here's to you and your temper \r\nYes, I remember what you said last night \r\nAnd I know that you see what you're doing to me \r\nTell me why.. \nYou could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day \r\nWell I get so confused and frustrated \r\nForget what i'm trying to say, oh \nI'm sick and tired of your reasons \r\nI got no one to believe in \r\nYou tell me that you want me, then push me around \r\nAnd I need you like a heartbeat \r\nBut you know you got a mean streak \r\nMakes me run for cover when you're around \r\nHere's to you and your temper \r\nYes, I remember what you said last night \r\nAnd I know that you see what you're doing to me \r\nTell me why.. \nWhy..do you have to make me feel small \r\nSo you can feel whole inside \r\nWhy..do you have to put down my dreams \r\nSo you're the only thing on my mind \nI'm sick and tired of your attitude \r\nI'm feeling like I don't know you \r\nYou tell me that you want me then cut me down \r\nI'm sick and tired of your reasons \r\nI've got no one to believe in \r\nYou ask me for my love then you push me around \r\nHere's to you and your temper \r\nYes, I remember what you said last night \r\nAnd I know that you see what you're doing to me \r\nTell me why \r\nWhy, tell me why \nI take a step back, let you go \r\nI told you i'm not bulletproof \r\nNow you know", "title": "Tell Me Why", "album": "Fearless", "year": "2008"}
