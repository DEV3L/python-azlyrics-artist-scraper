  "lyrics": "I could go back to every laugh\nBut I don't wanna' go there anymore\nAnd I know all the steps up to your door\nBut I don't wanna' go there anymore\nTalk to the wind, talk to the sky\nTalk to the man with the reasons why\nAnd let me know what you find\nI'll leave my window open\n'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name\nJust know I'm right here hopin'\nThat you'll come in with the rain\nI could stand up and sing you a song\nBut I don't wanna' have to go that far\nAnd I, I've got you down\nI know you by heart\nAnd you don't even know where I start\nTalk to yourself, talk to the tears\nTalk to the man who put you here\nAnd don't wait for the sky to clear\nI'll leave my window open\n'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name\nOh, just know I'm right here hopin'\nThat you'll come in with the rain\nI've watched you so long\nScreamed your name\nI don't know what else I can say\nBut I'll leave my window open\n'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games\nJust know I'm right here hopin'\nThat you'll come in with the rain\nI could go back to every laugh\nBut I don't wanna' go there anymore\u2026",
