  "lyrics": "You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors\nIt's the morning of your very first day\nYou say \"Hi\" to your friends you ain't seen in a while\nTry and stay out of everybody's way\nIt's your freshman year and you're gonna be here\nFor the next four years in this town\nHoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,\n\"You know I haven't seen you around before.\"\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen\nFeeling like there's nothing to figure out\nWell, count to ten, take it in\nThis is life before you know who you're gonna be\nFifteen\nYou sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail\nAnd soon enough you're best friends\nLaughing at the other girls who think they're so cool\nWe'll be out of here as soon as we can\nAnd then you're on your very first date and he's got a car\nAnd you're feeling like flying\nAnd your mamma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one\nAnd you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends\nWhen the night ends\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nWhen you're fifteen\nAnd your first kiss makes your head spin round\nBut in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team\nBut I didn't know it at fifteen\nWhen all you wanted was to be wanted\nWish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now\nBack then I swore I was gonna marry him someday\nBut I realized some bigger dreams of mine\nAnd Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind\nAnd we both cried\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen\nDon't forget to look before you fall\nI've found time can heal most anything\nAnd you just might find who you're supposed to be\nI didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la\nYour very first day\nTake a deep breath, girl\nTake a deep breath as you walk through the doors.",
