{"lyrics": "I could go back to every laugh,\r\nBut I don't wanna' go there anymore,\r\nAnd I know all the steps up to your door,\r\nBut I don't wanna' go there anymore.\nTalk to the wind, talk to the sky,\r\nTalk to the man with the reasons why,\r\nAnd let me know what you find.\nI\u2019ll leave my window open,\r\n\u2018Cause I\u2019m too tired at night to call your name.\r\nJust know I\u2019m right here hopin\u2019,\r\nThat you\u2019ll come in with the rain.\nI could stand up and sing you a song,\r\nBut I don\u2019t wanna\u2019 have to go that far.\r\nAnd I, I\u2019ve got you down,\r\nI know you by heart,\r\nAnd you don\u2019t even know where I start.\nTalk to yourself, talk to the tears,\r\nTalk to the man who put you here,\r\nAnd don\u2019t wait for the sky to clear.\nI\u2019ll leave my window open,\r\n\u2018Cus I\u2019m too tired at night to call your name.\r\nOh, just know I\u2019m right here hopin\u2019,\r\nThat you\u2019ll come in with the rain.\nI\u2019ve watched you so long,\r\nScreamed your name,\r\nI don\u2019t know what else I can say.\nBut I\u2019ll leave my window open,\r\n\u2018Cus I\u2019m too tired at night for all these games.\r\nJust know I\u2019m right here hopin\u2019,\r\nThat you\u2019ll come in with the rain.\nI could go back to every laugh,\r\nBut I don\u2019t wanna\u2019 go there anymore\u2026", "title": "Come In With The Rain", "album": "Fearless", "year": "2008"}
