{"lyrics": "\"Untouchable\"\nUntouchable like a distant diamond sky, Mmmm\nI'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why\nI'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you\nUntouchable, burning brighter than the sun\nAnd when you're close I feel like coming undone\nIn the middle of the night\nWhen I'm in this dream\nIt's like a million little stars\nSpelling out your name\nYou gotta come on, come on\nSay that we'll be together\nCome on, come on\nLittle taste of Heaven\nIt's half full and I won't wait here all day\nI know you're saying that you'll be here anyway\nBut you're untouchable\nBurning brighter than the sun\nNow that you're close I feel like coming undone\nIn the middle of the night\nWhen I'm in this dream\nIt's like a million little stars\nSpelling out your name\nYou gotta come on, come on\nSay that we'll be together\nCome on, come on\nOh, In the middle of the night\nWaking from this dream\nI wanna feel you by my side\nStanding next to me\nYou gotta come on, come on\nSay that we'll be together\nCome on, come on\nLittle taste of Heaven\nOh, oh I'm caught up in you\nOh, oh, oh\nUntouchable burning brighter than the sun\nAnd when you're close I feel like coming undone\nIn the middle of the night\nWhen I'm in this dream\nIt's like a million little stars\nSpelling out your name\nYou gotta come on, come on\nSay that we'll be together\nCome on, come on, oh oh\nOh, Oh, In the middle of the night\nWaking from this dream\nI wanna feel you by my side\nStanding next to me\nYou gotta come on, come on\nSay that we'll be together\nCome on, come on\nLittle taste of Heaven\nLike a million little stars, spelling out your name\nSpelling out your name", "title": "Untouchable", "year": "2008", "album": "Fearless"}
