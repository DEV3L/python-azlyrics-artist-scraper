  "lyrics": "(feat. Colbie Caillat)\nI see your face in my mind as I drive away\n'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.\nPeople are people, and sometimes we change our minds.\nBut it's killing me to see you go after all this time.\nMusic starts playin' like the end of a sad movie.\nIt's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.\n'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down.\nNow I don't know what to be without you around.\nAnd we know it's never simple, never easy,\nNever a clean break. No one here to save me.\nYou're the only thing I know like the back of my hand.\nAnd I can't breathe without you\nBut I have to.\nBreathe without you\nBut I have to.\nNever wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.\nEvery little bump in the road I tried to swerve.\nPeople are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out.\nNothing we say is gonna save us from the fallout.\nAnd we know it's never simple, never easy,\nNever a clean break. No one here to save me.\nYou're the only thing I know like the back of my hand.\nAnd I can't breathe without you\nBut I have to.\nBreathe without you\nBut I have to.\nIt's two AM.\nFeelin' like I just lost a friend.\nHope you know it's not easy, easy for me.\nIt's two AM.\nFeelin' like I just lost a friend.\nHope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.\nAnd we know it's never simple, never easy,\nNever a clean break. No one here to save me.\nI can't breathe without you\nBut I have to.\nBreathe without you\nBut I have to.\nBreathe without you\nBut I have to.\nI'm sorry.\nI'm sorry.\nI'm sorry.\nI'm sorry.\nI'm sorry.\nI'm sorry.\nI'm sorry",
