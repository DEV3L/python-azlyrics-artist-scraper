  "lyrics": "Once upon a time\nI believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye\nAnd we caught onto something\nI hold onto the night\nYou looked me in the eye and told me you loved me\nWere you just kidding cause it seems to me\nThis thing is breaking down, we almost never speak\nI don't feel welcome anymore\nBaby, what happened, please tell me\nCause one second it was perfect\nNow you're half way out the door\nAnd I stare at the phone\nHe still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low\nYou can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to\nWhen he said forever and always\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here\nAnd it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said forever and always\nWas I out of line?\nDid I say something way too honest?\nMade you run and hide like a scared little boy\nI looked into your eyes\nThought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure\nSo here's to everything coming down to nothing\nHere's to silence that cuts me to the core\nWhere is this going?\nThought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore\nAnd I stare at the phone\nHe still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low\nYou can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to\nWhen he said forever and always\nAnd it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here\nAnd it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said forever and always\nYou didn't mean it baby\nI don't think so, oh oh oh\nBack up, baby back up\nDid you forget everything?\nBack up, baby back up\nDid you forget everything?\nBack up, baby back up\nPlease back up, oh back up\nBack up, baby back up\nCause it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here\nAnd it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said forever and always\nAnd I stare at the phone\nHe still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low\nYou can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to\nWhen we said forever and always\nCause it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here\nAnd it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said forever and always\nYou didn't mean it baby\nYou said forever and always, yeah",
