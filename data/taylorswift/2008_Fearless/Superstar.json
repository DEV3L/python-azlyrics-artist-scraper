{"lyrics": "\"Superstar\"\nThis is wrong but I can't help but feel like\nThere ain't nothing more right babe\nMisty morning comes again and I can't\nHelp but wish I could see your face\nAnd I knew from the first note played\nI'd be breaking all my rules to see you\nYou smile that beautiful smile and\nAll the girls in the front row scream your name\nSo dim that spotlight, tell me things like\nI can't take my eyes off of you\nI'm no one special, just another\nWide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you\nGive me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar\nGood morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not\nDreaming about you\nWhen my world wakes up today\nYou'll be in another town\nAnd I knew when I saw your face, I'd be\nCounting down the ways to see you\nYou smile that beautiful smile and\nAll the girls in the front row scream your name\nSo dim that spotlight, tell me things like\nI can't take my eyes off of you\nI'm no one special, just another\nWide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you\nGive me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar\nYou played in bars, you play guitar\nI'm invisible and everyone knows who you are\nAnd you'll never see, sing me to sleep\nEvery night from the radio\nSo dim that spotlight, tell me things like\nI can't take my eyes off of you\nI'm no one special, just another\nWide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you\nGive me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar\nSweet, sweet superstar, superstar", "title": "Superstar", "year": "2008", "album": "Fearless"}
