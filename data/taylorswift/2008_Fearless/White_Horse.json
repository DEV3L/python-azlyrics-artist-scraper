{"lyrics": "Say you're sorry\nThat face of an angel\nComes out just when you need it to\nAs I paced back and forth all this time\n'Cause I honestly believed in you\nHolding on\nThe days drag on\nStupid girl,\nI should have known, I should have known\n[Chorus:]\nThat I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,\nI'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,\nLead her up the stairwell\nThis ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,\nI was a dreamer before you went and let me down,\nNow it's too late for you and your white horse to come around\nMaybe I was na\u00efve,\nGot lost in your eyes\nAnd never really had a chance\nMy mistake, I didn't know to be in love\nYou had to fight to have the upper hand\nI had so many dreams\nAbout you and me\nHappy endings\nNow I know\n[Chorus:]\nThat I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,\nI'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,\nLead her up the stairwell\nThis ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,\nI was a dreamer before you went and let me down,\nNow it's too late for you and your white horse to come around\nAnd there you are on your knees,\nBegging for forgiveness, begging for me\nJust like I always wanted but I'm so sorry\n'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale,\nI'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well\nThis is a big world, that was a small town\nThere in my rear view mirror disappearing now\nAnd it's too late for you and your white horse\nNow it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now\nOh, whoa, whoa, whoa\nTry and catch me now\nOh, it's too late\nTo catch me now", "title": "White Horse", "album": "Fearless", "year": "2008"}
