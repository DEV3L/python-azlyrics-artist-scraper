"{'album': 'Fearless', 'title': 'Change', 'lyrics': '\"Change\"\\nAnd it\u2019s a sad picture,\\nThe final blow hits you\\nSomebody else gets what you wanted again\\nAnd you know it\u2019s all the same,\\nAnother time and place\\nRepeating history and you\u2019re getting sick of it\\nBut I believe in whatever you do\\nAnd I\u2019ll do anything to see it through\\nBecause these things will change\\nCan you feel it now?\\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\\nThis revolution, the time will come\\nFor us to finally win\\nAnd we\u2019ll sing hallelujah, we\u2019ll sing hallelujah\\nSo we\u2019ve been outnumbered\\nRaided and now cornered\\nIt\u2019s hard to fight when the fight ain\u2019t fair\\nWe\u2019re getting stronger now\\nFind things they never found\\nThey might be bigger\\nBut we\u2019re faster and never scared\\nYou can walk away, say we don\u2019t need this\\nBut there\u2019s something in your eyes says we can beat this\\n\\'Cause these things will change\\nCan you feel it now?\\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\\nThis revolution, the time will come\\nFor us to finally win\\nAnd we\u2019ll sing hallelujah, we\\'ll sing hallelujah\\nTonight we\\'ll stand, get off our knees\\nFight for what we\u2019ve worked for all these years\\nAnd the battle was long, it\u2019s the fight of our lives\\nBut we\u2019ll stand up champions tonight\\nIt was the night things changed\\nCan you see it now?\\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back fell down\\nThis revolution, throw your hands up\\n\\'Cause we never gave in\\nAnd we\\'ll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah\\nHallelujah', 'year': '2008'}"
