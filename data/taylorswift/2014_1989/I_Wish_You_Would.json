{"lyrics": "\"I Wish You Would\"\nIt's 2 AM in your car\nWindows down, you pass my street, the memories start\nYou say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead\nYou're thinking that I hate you now\n'Cause you still don't know what I never said\nI wish you would come back,\nWish I never hung up the phone like I did.\nAnd I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.\nAnd I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.\nI wish you would\nIt's 2 AM in my room.\nHeadlights pass the window pane, I think of you.\nWe're a crooked love in a straight line down.\nMakes you wanna run and hide\nThen it makes you turn right back around\nI wish you would come back,\nWish I never hung up the phone like I did.\nI wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.\nAnd I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.\nI wish you would\nI wish we could go back\nAnd remember what we were fighting for.\nAnd I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore\nAnd I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.\nI wish you would\nI, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish\nI, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish\nI, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish.\nYou always knew how to push my buttons\nYou give me everything and nothing\nThis mad mad love makes you come running\nTo stand back where you stood\nI wish you would, I wish you would\nI wish you would, I wish you would\nI, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish...\n2 AM, here we are\nSee your face, hear my voice in the dark\nWe're a crooked love in a straight line down\nMakes you wanna run and hide\nBut it made us turn right back around\nI wish you would come back\nWish I never hung up the phone like I did\nI wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.\nAnd I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.\nI wish you would\nI wish you would come back,\nWish I never hung up the phone like I did.\nAnd I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.\nAnd I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.\nI wish you would\nI wish we could go back\nAnd remember what we were fighting for.\nAnd I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore.\nAnd I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.\nI wish you would\nYou always knew how to push my buttons\nYou give me everything and nothing\nThis mad mad love makes you come running\nTo stand back where you stood\nI wish you would, I wish you would\nI wish you would, I wish you would\nI, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish\nI, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish\nI, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish you would", "title": "I Wish You Would", "year": "2014", "album": "1989"}
