"{'album': '1989', 'title': 'I Know Places', 'lyrics': '\"I Know Places\"\\nYou stand with your hand on my waist line\\nIt\\'s a scene and we\\'re out here in plain sight\\nI can hear them whisper as we pass by\\nIt\\'s a bad sign, bad sign\\nSomething happens when everybody finds out\\nSee the vultures circling dark clouds\\nLove\\'s a fragile little flame, it could burn out\\nIt could burn out \\nCause they got the cages, they got the boxes\\nAnd guns\\nThey are the hunters, we are the foxes\\nAnd we run\\nBaby, I know places we won\\'t be found \\nAnd they\\'ll be chasing their tails tryin\\' to track us down\\nCause I, I know places we can hide\\nI know places, I know places\\nLights flash and we\\'ll run for the fences\\nLet them say what they want, we won\\'t hear it\\nLoose lips sink ships all the damn time\\nNot this time \\nJust grab my hand and don\\'t ever drop it\\nMy love\\nThey are the hunters, we are the foxes\\nAnd we run\\nBaby, I know places we won\\'t be found \\nAnd they\\'ll be chasing their tails tryin\\' to track us down\\nCause I, I know places we can hide\\nI know places \\nThey are the hunters, we are the foxes\\nAnd we run\\nJust grab my hand and don\\'t ever drop it\\nMy love\\nBaby, I know places we won\\'t be found \\nAnd they\\'ll be chasing their tails tryin\\' to track us down\\nCause I, I know places we can hide\\nI know places\\nThey take their shots, but we\\'re bulletproof\\nI know places\\nAnd you know for me, it\\'s always you\\nI know places\\nIn the dead of night, your eyes so green\\nI know places\\nAnd I know for you, it\\'s always me\\nI know places', 'year': '2014'}"
