"{'album': '1989', 'title': 'Out Of The Woods', 'lyrics': '\"Out Of The Woods\"\\nLooking at it now\\nIt all seems so simple\\nWe were lying on your couch\\nI remember\\nYou took a Polaroid of us\\nThen discovered (then discovered)\\nThe rest of the world was black and white\\nBut we were in screaming color\\nAnd I remember thinking\u2026\\n[Chorus 2x:]\\nAre we out of the woods yet?\\nAre we out of the woods yet?\\nAre we out of the woods yet?\\nAre we out of the woods?\\nAre we in the clear yet?\\nAre we in the clear yet?\\nAre we in the clear yet?\\nIn the clear yet?\\nGood\\nAre we out of the woods?\\nLooking at it now\\nLast December (last December)\\nWe were built to fall apart\\nThen fall back together (back together)\\nYour necklace hanging from my neck\\nThe night we couldn\\'t quite forget\\nWhen we decided (we decided)\\nTo move the furniture so we could dance,\\nBaby, like we stood a chance\\nTwo paper airplanes flying, flying, flying\\nAnd I remember thinkin\\'\\n[Chorus 2x]\\n(Are we out of the woods?!)\\nRemember when you hit the brakes too soon?\\nTwenty stitches in the hospital room\\nWhen you started cryin\\', baby, I did, too\\nBut when the sun came up, I was lookin\\' at you\\nRemember when we couldn\\'t take the heat\\nI walked out and said, \"I\\'m settin\\' you free,\"\\nBut the monsters turned out to be just trees\\nAnd when the sun came up, you were lookin\\' at me\\nYou were lookin\\' at me\\nYou were lookin\\' at me,\\nI remember, oh, I remember\\n[Chorus 4x]', 'year': '2014'}"
