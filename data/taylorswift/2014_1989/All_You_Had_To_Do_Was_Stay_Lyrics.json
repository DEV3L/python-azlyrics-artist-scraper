  "lyrics": "People like you always want back the love they gave away\nAnd people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed\nThe more I think about it now the less I know\nAll I know is that you drove us off the road\nStay\nHey, all you had to do was stay\nHad me in the palm of your hand\nThen why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?\nStay\nHey, now you say you want it back\nNow that it's just too late\nWell, it could've been easy\nAll you had to do was stay\nAll you had to do was stay\nAll you had to do was stay\nAll you had to do was stay\nAll you had to do was stay\nHere you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say\nI've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made\nPeople like you always want back the love they pushed aside\nBut people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye\nStay\nHey, all you had to do was stay\nHad me in the palm of your hand\nThen why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?\nStay\nHey, now you say you want it back\nNow that it's just too late\nWell, it could've been easy\nAll you had to do was stay\nAll you had to do was stay\nAll you had to do was stay\nAll you had to do was stay, stay, stay, stay, stay\nLet me remind you\nThis was what you wanted\nYou ended it\nYou were all I wanted\nBut not like this\nNot like this\nNot like this\nOh, all you had to do was...\nStay\nHey, all you had to do was stay\nHad me in the palm of your hand\nThen why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?\nStay\nHey, now you say you want it back\nNow that it's just too late\nWell, it could've been easy\nAll you had to do was stay\nHey, all you had to do was stay\nHad me in the palm of your hand\nThen why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?\nStay\nHey, now you say you want it back\nNow that it's just too late\n(All you had to do was stay)\nWell, it could've been easy\nAll you had to do was stay\nAll you had to do was stay\nAll you had to do was stay\nAll you had to do was stay\nAll you had to do was stay",
