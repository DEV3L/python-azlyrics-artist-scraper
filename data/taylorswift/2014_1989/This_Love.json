"{'album': '1989', 'title': 'This Love', 'lyrics': '\"This Love\"\\nClear blue water, high tide came and brought you in\\nAnd I could go on and on, on and on, and I will\\nSkies grew darker, currents swept you out again\\nAnd you were just gone and gone, gone and gone\\nIn silent screams,\\nIn wildest dreams\\nI never dreamed of this\\nThis love is good, this love is bad\\nThis love is alive back from the dead\\nThese hands had to let it go free\\nAnd this love came back to me\\nTossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new\\nAnd I could go on and on, on and on\\nLantern burning, flickered in my mind for only you\\nBut you\\'re still gone, gone, gone\\nBeen losing grip,\\nOn sinking ships\\nYou showed up just in time\\nThis love is good, this love is bad\\nThis love is alive back from the dead\\nThese hands had to let it go free\\nAnd this love came back to me\\nThis love left a permanent mark\\nThis love is glowing in the dark\\nThese hands had to let it go free\\nAnd this love came back to me\\nThis love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]\\nYour kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave\\nYour smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees\\nWhen you\\'re young you just run\\nBut you come back to what you need\\nThis love is good, this love is bad\\nThis love is alive back from the dead\\nThese hands had to let it go free\\nAnd this love came back to me\\nThis love left a permanent mark\\nThis love is glowing in the dark\\nThese hands had to let it go free\\nAnd this love came back to me\\nThis love, this love, this love, this love...
