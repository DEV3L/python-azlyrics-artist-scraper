  "lyrics": "[Music video version:]\n\"The fans are the best part of this tour\nThey are the reason the shows are incredible\nAnd I know those fans out there, are just all in\"\nWe're all bored, we're all so tired of everything\nWe wait for trains that just aren't coming\nWe show off our different scarlet letters\nTrust me, mine is better\nWe're so young but we're on the road to ruin\nWe play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing\nWe cry tears of mascara in the bathroom\nHoney, life is just a classroom\n'Cause, baby, I could build a castle\nOut of all the bricks they threw at me\nAnd every day is like a battle\nBut every night with us is like a dream\nBaby, we're the new romantics\nCome on, come along with me\nHeart break is the national anthem\nWe sing it proudly\nWe are too busy dancing\nTo get knocked off our feet\nBaby, we're the new romantics\nThe best people in life are free\nWe're all here, the lights and noise are blinding\nWe hang back, it's all in the timing\nIt's poker, he can't see it in my face\nBut I'm about to play my Ace\nWe need love, but all we want is danger\nWe team up then switch sides like a record changer\nThe rumors are terrible and cruel\nBut, honey, most of them are true\n'Cause, baby, I could build a castle\nOut of all the bricks they threw at me\nAnd every day is like a battle\nBut every night with us is like a dream\nBaby, we're the new romantics\nCome on, come along with me\nHeart break is the national anthem\nWe sing it proudly\nWe are too busy dancing\nTo get knocked off our feet\nBaby, we're the new romantics\nThe best people in life are free\nSo come on, come along with me\nThe best people in life are free\nPlease take my hand and\nPlease take me dancing and\nPlease leave me stranded\nIt's so romantic\n[Music video version:]\n\"I don't want to forget anything that happened on this tour\nIt was one of those remarkable moments in time when everything felt exciting\"\n'Cause, baby, I could build a castle\nOut of all the bricks they threw at me\nAnd every day is like a battle\nBut every night with us is like a dream\n'Cause, baby, I could build a castle\nOut of all the bricks they threw at me\nAnd every day is like a battle\nBut every night with us is like a dream\nBaby, we're the new romantics\nCome on, come along with me\nHeart break is the national anthem\nWe sing it proudly\nWe are too busy dancing\nTo get knocked off our feet\nBaby, we're the new romantics\nThe best people in life are free\n[Music video version:]\n\"Looking out into like an endless ocean of crowd\nThat was everything\nWe're all really sad that it is ending\nBut we're all really happy because of what it was\"",
