{"lyrics": "\"Style\"\nMidnight,\nYou come and pick me up, no headlights\nA long drive,\nCould end in burning flames or paradise\nFade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)\nI should just tell you to leave 'cause I\nKnow exactly where it leads but I\nWatch us go 'round and 'round each time\nYou got that James Dean daydream look in your eye\nAnd I got that red lip classic thing that you like\nAnd when we go crashing down, we come back every time\n'Cause we never go out of style\nWe never go out of style\nYou got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt\nAnd I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt\nAnd when we go crashing down, we come back every time\n'Cause we never go out of style\nWe never go out of style.\nSo it goes\nHe can't keep his wild eyes on the road\nTakes me home\nLights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah.\nI say, \"I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl.\"\nHe says, \"What you've heard is true but I\nCan't stop thinking about you,\" and I...\nI said, \"I've been there, too, a few times.\"\n'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye\nAnd I got that red lip classic thing that you like\nAnd when we go crashing down, we come back every time\n'Cause we never go out of style\nWe never go out of style\nYou got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt\nAnd I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)\nAnd when we go crashing down, we come back every time\n'Cause we never go out of style\nWe never go out of style\nTake me home\nJust take me home, yeah.\nJust take me home\n(out of style)\nYou got that James Dean daydream look in your eye\nAnd I got that red lip classic thing that you like\nAnd when we go crashing down, we come back every time\n'Cause we never go out of style\nWe never go out of style", "title": "Style", "year": "2014", "album": "1989"}
