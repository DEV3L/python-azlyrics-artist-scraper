{"lyrics": "\"Welcome To New York\"\nWalking through a crowd\nThe village is aglow\nKaleidoscope of loud\nHeartbeats under coats\nEverybody here\nWanted something more\nSearching for a sound we hadn't\nHeard before\nAnd it said\n[Chorus:]\nWelcome to New York\nIt's been waiting for you\nWelcome to New York\nWelcome to New York\nWelcome to New York\nIt's been waiting for you\nWelcome to New York\nWelcome to New York\nIt's a new soundtrack\nI could dance to this beat, beat\nForever more\nThe lights are so bright\nBut they never blind me, me\nWelcome to New York\nIt's been waiting for you\nWelcome to New York\nWhen we first dropped our bags on\nApartment floors\nTook our broken hearts\nPut them in a drawer\nEverybody here was someone else\nBefore\nAnd you can want who you want\nBoys and boys and\nGirls and girls\n[Chorus:]\nWelcome to New York\nIt's been waiting for you\nWelcome to New York\nWelcome to New York\nWelcome to New York\nIt's been waiting for you\nWelcome to New York\nWelcome to New York\nIt's a new soundtrack\nI could dance to this beat, beat\nForever more\nThe lights are so bright\nBut they never blind me, me\nWelcome to New York (New York)\nIt's been waiting for you\nWelcome to New York\nWelcome to New York\nLike any great love it keeps you\nGuessing\nLike any real love\nIt's ever changing\nLike any true love\nIt drives you crazy\nBut you know you wouldn't\nChange anything anything\nAnything\n[Chorus:]\nWelcome to New York\nIt's been waiting for you\nWelcome to New York\nWelcome to New York\nWelcome to New York\nIt's been waiting for you\nWelcome to New York\nWelcome to New York\nIt's a new soundtrack\nI could dance to this beat\nThe lights are so bright\nBut they never blind me\nWelcome to New York\nNew soundtrack\nIt's been waiting for you\nWelcome to New York\nThe lights are so bright\nBut they never blind me\nWelcome to New York\nSo bright\nThey never blind me\nWelcome to New York\nWelcome to New York", "title": "Welcome To New York", "year": "2014", "album": "1989"}
