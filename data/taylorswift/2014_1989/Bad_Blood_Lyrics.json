I was thinking that you could be trusted\nDid you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted\nDid you have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe\nAnd rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me\nOh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood\nHey\nNow we got problems\nAnd I don't think we can solve them\nYou made a really deep cut\nAnd, baby, now we got bad blood\nHey\nDid you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife\nSo don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.\nNow did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you\nAnd time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't\nOh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood\nHey\nNow we got problems\nAnd I don't think we can solve them\nYou made a really deep cut\nAnd, baby, now we got bad blood\nHey\nBand-aids don't fix bullet holes\nYou say sorry just for show\nIf you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts)\nBand-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey)\nYou say sorry just for show (hey)\nIf you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey)\nMhmmm\nIf you love like that blood runs cold\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love (mad love)\nSo take a look what you've done\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood\nHey\nNow we got problems\nAnd I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them)\nYou made a really deep cut\nAnd, baby, now we got bad blood\n(Hey)\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done (look what you've done)\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood\nHey\nNow we got problems\nAnd I don't think we can solve them\nYou made a really deep cut\nAnd, baby, now we got bad blood\nHey",
