  "lyrics": "The drought was the very worst\nWhen the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst\nIt was months and months of back and forth\nYou're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore\nHung my head as I lost the war\nand the sky turned black like a perfect storm\nRain came pouring down when I was drowning\nThat's when I could finally breathe\nAnd by morning gone was any trace of you,\nI think I am finally clean\nThere was nothing left to do\nWhen the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room\nSo I punched a hole in the roof\nLet the flood carry away all my pictures of you\nThe water filled my lungs\nI screamed so loud but no one heard a thing\nRain came pouring down when I was drowning\nThat's when I could finally breathe\nAnd by morning gone was any trace of you,\nI think I am finally clean\nI think I am finally clean\nSaid I think I am finally clean\n10 months sober, I must admit\nJust because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it\n10 months older, I won't give in\nNow that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it\nThe drought was the very worst\nWhen the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst\nRain came pouring down when I was drowning\nThat's when I could finally breathe\nAnd by morning gone was any trace of you,\nI think I am finally clean\nRain came pouring down when I was drowning\nThat's when I could finally breathe\nAnd by morning gone was any trace of you\nI think I am finally clean\nFinally clean\nThink I'm finally clean\nThink I'm finally clean",
