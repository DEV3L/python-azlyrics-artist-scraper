{"lyrics": "\"Wildest Dreams\"\nHe said, \"Let's get out of this town.\nDrive out of the city, away from the crowds.\"\nI thought heaven can't help me now.\nNothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down\nHe's so tall and handsome as hell\nHe's so bad but he does it so well\nI can see the end as it begins\nMy one condition is\nSay you'll remember me\nStanding in a nice dress,\nStaring at the sunset, babe\nRed lips and rosy cheeks\nSay you'll see me again\nEven if it's just in your\nWildest dreams, ah-ha oh,\nWildest dreams, ah-ha oh.\nI said, \"No one has to know what we do.\"\nHis hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room\nAnd his voice is a familiar sound,\nNothing lasts forever but this is getting good now\nHe's so tall and handsome as hell\nHe's so bad but he does it so well\nAnd when we've had our very last kiss\nMy last request is\nSay you'll remember me\nStanding in a nice dress,\nStaring at the sunset, babe\nRed lips and rosy cheeks\nSay you'll see me again\nEven if it's just in your\nWildest dreams, ah-ha oh,\nWildest dreams, ah-ha oh.\nYou see me in hindsight\nTangled up with you all night\nBurning it down\nSomeday when you leave me\nI bet these memories\nFollow you around\nYou'll see me in hindsight\nTangled up with you all night\nBurning it down\nSomeday when you leave me\nI bet these memories\nFollow you around\nSay you'll remember me\nStanding in a nice dress,\nStaring at the sunset, babe\nRed lips and rosy cheeks\nSay you'll see me again\nEven if it's just pretend\nSay you'll remember me\nStanding in a nice dress,\nStaring at the sunset, babe\nRed lips and rosy cheeks\nSay you'll see me again\nEven if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend)\nWildest dreams, ah-ha oh\nIn your wildest dreams, ah-ha oh\n(even if it's just in your wildest dreams) ah-ha\nIn your wildest dreams, ah-ha.", "title": "Wildest Dreams", "year": "2014", "album": "1989"}
