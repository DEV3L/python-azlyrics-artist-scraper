"{'album': None, 'title': 'By The Way', 'lyrics': '\"By The Way\"\\nI had to catch my breath\\nWhen I saw you there across the room\\nHolding her hand\\nI\\'d have never guessed\\nThat starting over would look so good on you\\nBut here I am\\nStill believing there might come a day\\nWe\\'ll pick up where we left off\\nAnd by the way\\nYour eyes are dancing\\nI\\'d say the chances of that are getting slim\\nBy the way\\nMy heart\\'s still breaking\\nIt\\'s gonna take it a while to love again\\nSo many things that I forgot to say\\nBy the way\\nI should\\'ve let you know\\nAll the ways you made me feel alive\\nI guess it\\'s too late\\nSo I\\'ll just get my coat\\nAnd make my way into this breezy night\\nGive you one last wave\\nMaybe you\\'ll drop what you\\'re doing\\nAnd come over here to say \\nI\\'m looking good\\nBut by the way\\nYour eyes are dancing\\nI\\'d say the chances of that are getting slim\\nBy the way\\nMy heart\\'s still breaking\\nIt\\'s gonna take it a while to love again\\nSo many things that I forgot to say\\nBy the way\\nYou still look amazing\\nAnd I must\\'ve been crazy to let you get away\\nBy the way\\nIf you ever wondered\\nStill got the same old number; just in case\\nI still miss you\\nAnd i still love you\\nBy the way\\nBy the way, oh', 'year': None}"
