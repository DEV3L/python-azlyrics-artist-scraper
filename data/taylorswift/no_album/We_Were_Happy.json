"{'album': None, 'title': 'We Were Happy', 'lyrics': '\"We Were Happy\"\\nWe used to walk along the street\\nWhen the porch lights were shining bright\\nBefore I had somewhere to be\\nBack when we had all night\\nAnd we were happy\\nI do recall a good while back\\nWe snuck into the circus\\nYou threw your arms around my neck\\nBack when I deserved it\\nAnd we were happy\\nWhen it was good baby,\\nIt was good baby\\nWe showed \\'um all up\\nNo one could touch the way we\\nLaughed in the dark\\nTalking \\'bout your daddy\\'s farm\\nWe were gonna buy someday\\nAnd we were happy\\nWe used to watch the sun go down\\nOn the boats in the water\\nThat\\'s sorta how I feel right now\\nAnd Goodbye\\'s so much harder\\n\\'Cause we were happy\\nWhen it was good baby,\\nIt was good baby\\nWe showed \\'um all up\\nNo one could touch the way we\\nLaughed in the dark\\nTalking \\'bout your daddy\\'s farm\\nWe were gonna buy someday\\nAnd we were happy\\nOh, I hate those voices\\nTelling me I\\'m not in love anymore\\nBut they don\\'t give me choices\\nAnd that\\'s what these tears are for\\n\\'Cause we were happy\\nWe Were Happy\\nWhen it was good baby,\\nIt was good baby\\nWe showed \\'um all up\\nNo one could touch the way we\\nLaughed in the dark\\nTalking \\'bout your daddy\\'s farm\\nAnd you were gonna marry me\\nWhen we were happy\\nYeah, We were were happy\\nOh-oh, oh-oh-oh\\nWe Were happy', 'year': None}"
