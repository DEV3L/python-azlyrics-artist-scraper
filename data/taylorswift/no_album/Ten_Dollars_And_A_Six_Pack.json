"{'album': None, 'title': 'Ten Dollars And A Six Pack', 'lyrics': '\"Ten Dollars And A Six Pack\"\\nYou were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn\\'t have\\nYou were country lovin\\' really somethin\\' for three months and a half\\nEverybody said that you were bad news\\nbut baby I was betting on you\\nSo I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack\\nGot myself a big country serving to pay back\\nNow I\\'m gonna have to listen to my mumma\\'s \"I told you so\"\\nBut you weren\\'t even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack\\nI said let them say we\\'re crazy, you said let\\'s go fishing a lot\\nThe midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes\\nEverything changed when you took me to town\\nCaught you staring every other girl down\\nSo I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack\\nGot myself a big country serving to pay back\\nNow I\\'m gonna have to listen to my mumma\\'s \"I told you so\"\\nBut you weren\\'t even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack\\nCan\\'t believe the time you lost me\\nCan\\'t believe what it cost me\\nCause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack\\nGot myself a big ol serving to pay back\\nI had to listen to my mumma\\'s \"I told you so\"\\nYou ain\\'t never been through that\\nYou ain\\'t worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack\\nYou ain\\'t worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack', 'year': None}"
