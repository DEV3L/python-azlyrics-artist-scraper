"{'album': None, 'title': \"Sweet Tea And God's Graces\", 'lyrics': '\"Sweet Tea And God\\'s Graces\"\\nTire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze\\nWhistle County creek\\nLaying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass\\nBaby, you were watching me\\nCold barn struck bed, everything you said\\nSlowly educating me\\nI never had a lesson so sweet\\nYou can get high on a first kiss\\nYou can get by with sweet tea and God\\'s graces\\nYou can love like a sinner and lose like a winner\\nNothing\\'s shatterproof\\nYou can crash and burn and come back someone new\\nAnd that\\'s what I learned from you\\nAutumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change\\nJust like the two of us\\nStill got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket\\nGuess I loved you way too much\\nBut I\\'m a little smarter, my heart\\'s a little harder\\nBut it\\'s still soft enough to cry\\nCause I remember those times\\nI remember.........\\nYou can get high on a first kiss\\nYou can get by with sweet tea and God\\'s graces\\nYou can love like a sinner and lose like a winner\\nNothing\\'s shatterproof\\nYou can crash and burn and come back someone new\\nAnd that\\'s what I learned from you\\nSaw you just the other day\\nAll that I could think to say was,\\n\"Hey, how have you been?\"\\nYou caught me with that old smile\\nSaid, \"It\\'s really been a while,\\nAnd I still think about back when..\"\\nWe used to get high on the first kiss\\nWe could get by with sweet tea and Jesus\\nAnd you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner\\nNothing\\'s shatterproof\\nYou can crash and burn and now I\\'m someone new\\nAnd that\\'s what I learned from you\\nOh, that\\'s what I learned from you\\nThat\\'s what I learned from you, oh you, oh\\nThat\\'s what I learned from you, oh yeah', 'year': None}"
