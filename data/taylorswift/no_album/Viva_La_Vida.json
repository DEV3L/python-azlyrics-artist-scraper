"{'album': None, 'title': 'Viva La Vida', 'lyrics': '\"Viva La Vida\"\\nI used to rule the world\\nSeas would rise when I gave the word\\nNow in the morning I sleep alone\\nSweep the streets I used to own\\nI used to roll the dice\\nFeel the fear in my enemy\\'s eyes\\nListen as the crowd would sing\\n\u201cNow the old king is dead! Long live the king!\u201d\\nOne minute I held the keys\\nNext the doors were closed on me\\nAnd I discovered that my castles stand\\nUpon pillars of salt, pillars of sand\\nI hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing\\nRoman Cavalry choirs are singing\\nBe my mirror, my sword and shield\\nMy missionaries in a foreign field\\nFor some reason I can\\'t explain\\nOnce you go there was never\\nNever an honest word\\nBut that was when I ruled the world\\nIt was a wicked and wild wind\\nBlew down the doors to let me in\\nShattered windows and the sound of drums\\nPeople couldn\\'t believe what I\\'d become\\nRevolutionaries wait\\nFor my head on a silver plate\\nJust a puppet on a lonely string\\nOh who would ever wanna be king?\\nI hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing\\nRoman Cavalry choirs are singing\\nBe my mirror, my sword and shield\\nMy missionaries in a foreign field\\nFor some reason I can\\'t explain\\nI know Saint Peter won\\'t call my name\\nNever an honest word\\nBut that was when I ruled the world\\nFor some reason I can\\'t explain\\nI know Saint Peter won\\'t call my name\\nNever an honest word\\nBut that was when I ruled the world', 'year': None}"
