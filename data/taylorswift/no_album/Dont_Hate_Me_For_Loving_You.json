"{'album': None, 'title': \"Don't Hate Me For Loving You\", 'lyrics': '\"Don\\'t Hate Me For Loving You\"\\nMy momma stood across the room\\nFace to face but never eye to eye\\nRecalling words we said\\nThe battle that we swore\\nWe\\'d never fight\\nBreaking pieces off with every lie\\nA tear came to her eye\\nAnd she said\\nDon\\'t walk away now\\nAnd don\\'t rip my heart out\\nDon\\'t you block me out tonight\\nHoney where are you?\\nAnd don\\'t hate me for loving you\\nHe walked around my life\\nAnd made blind\\nWith every single move\\nHe caught me staring at him\\nMad about him\\nLittle that I knew \\nLove is different\\nWhen you play the fool\\nAnd all I wanna do is say\\nDon\\'t walk away now\\nAnd don\\'t rip my heart out\\nDon\\'t you make cry tonight\\nLike you always do\\nAnd don\\'t hate me for loving you\\nI slammed the door\\nSat on the floor\\nCried into my bed\\nSaid are you there?\\nDo you even care?\\nTo cross above my head\\nBut someone said\\nDon\\'t turn away now\\nAnd don\\'t rip my heart out\\nThings are meant to happen like this\\nI know it\\'s right for you\\nAnd don\\'t hate me for loving you\\nI looked up at the sky\\nFace to face and finally\\nEye to eye', 'year': None}"
