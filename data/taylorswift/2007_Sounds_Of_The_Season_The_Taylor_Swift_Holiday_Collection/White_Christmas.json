{"lyrics": "\"White Christmas\"\nI'm dreaming of a white Christmas\r\nJust like the ones I used to know\r\nWhere the tree tops glisten and children listen\r\nTo hear sleigh bells in the snow\nI'm dreaming of a white Christmas\r\nWith every Christmas card I write\r\nMay your days be merry and bright\r\nAnd may all your Christmases be white\nI'm dreaming of a white Christmas\r\nJust like the ones I used to know\r\nSo may your days be merry and bright\r\nAnd may all your Christmases be white\nMay your days be merry and bright\r\nAnd may all your Christmases be white", "title": "White Christmas", "year": "2007", "album": "Sounds Of The Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection"}
