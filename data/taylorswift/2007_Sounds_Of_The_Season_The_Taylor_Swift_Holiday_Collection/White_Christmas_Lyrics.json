  "lyrics": "I'm dreaming of a white Christmas\nJust like the ones I used to know\nWhere the tree tops glisten and children listen\nTo hear sleigh bells in the snow\nI'm dreaming of a white Christmas\nWith every Christmas card I write\nMay your days be merry and bright\nAnd may all your Christmases be white\nI'm dreaming of a white Christmas\nJust like the ones I used to know\nSo may your days be merry and bright\nAnd may all your Christmases be white\nMay your days be merry and bright\nAnd may all your Christmases be white",
