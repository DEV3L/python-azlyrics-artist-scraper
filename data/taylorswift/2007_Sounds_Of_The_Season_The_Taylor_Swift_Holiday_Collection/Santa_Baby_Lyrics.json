  "lyrics": "Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree for me\nI've been an awful good girl, Santa baby\nSo hurry down the chimney tonight\nSanta baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue\nWell, I'll wait up for you, dear, Santa baby\nSo hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah\nThink of all the fun I've missed\nThink of all the boys I haven't kissed\nNext year I could be just as good\nIf you check off my Christmas list\nSanta baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot\nI've been an angel all year, Santa baby\nSo hurry down the chimney tonight\nSanta, honey, there's one more thing I really do need,\nThe deed\nTo a platinum mine, Santa honey\nSo hurry down the chimney tonight\nCome and trim my Christmas tree\nWith some decorations bought at Tiffany's\nI really do believe in you\nLet's see if you believe in me\nSanta baby, forgot to mention one little thing\nA ring\nAnd I don't mean on the phone, Santa baby\nSo hurry down the chimney tonight",
