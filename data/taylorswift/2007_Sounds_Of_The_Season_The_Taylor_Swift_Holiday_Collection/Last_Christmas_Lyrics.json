  "lyrics": "Last Christmas I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day, you gave it away\nThis year,\nTo save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special\nOnce bitten and twice shy\nI keep my distance but you still catch my eye\nTell me, baby, do you recognize me?\nWell, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me\nMerry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it\nWith a note saying 'I love you'. I meant it\nNow I know what a fool I've been\nBut if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again\nLast Christmas I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day, you gave it away\nThis year,\nTo save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special\nLast Christmas I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day, you gave it away\nThis year,\nTo save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special\nA crowded room and friends with tired eyes\nI'm hiding from you and your soul of ice\nMy God, I thought you were someone to rely on\nMe? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on\nA face on a lover with a fire in his heart\nA girl on a cover but you tore her apart\nMaybe this year\nMaybe this year I'll give it to someone special\n'Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day, you gave it away\nThis year,\nTo save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special\nLast Christmas I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day, you gave it away\nThis year,\nTo save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special\nAnd last Christmas\nAnd this year\nIt won't be anything like, anything like\nLast Christmas I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day, you gave it away\nThis year,\nTo save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special",
