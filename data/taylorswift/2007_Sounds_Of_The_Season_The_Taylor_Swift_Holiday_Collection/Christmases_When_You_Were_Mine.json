{"lyrics": "Please take down the misletoe\r\nCause I don't wanna think about that right now\r\nCause everything I want is miles away\r\nIn a snow covered little town\r\nMy momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me\r\nSeason's greetings, hope you're well\r\nWell I'm doing alright\r\nIf you were wondering\r\nLately I can never tell\nI know this shouldn't be a lonely time\r\nBut there were Christmases when you were mine\nI've been doing fine without you, really\r\nUp until the nights got cold\r\nAnd everybody's here, except you, baby\r\nSeems like everyone's got someone to hold\nBut for me it's just a lonely time\r\nCause there were Christmases when you were mine\nMerry Christmas everybody\r\nThat'll have to be something I just say this year\r\nI'll bet you got your mom another sweater\r\nAnd were your cousins late again\r\nWhen you were putting up the lights this year\r\nDid you notice one less pair of hands\nI know this shouldn't be a lonely time\r\nBut there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight\r\nCause there were Christmases when you were mine\nYou were mine", "title": "Christmases When You Were Mine", "album": "Sounds Of The Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection", "year": "2007"}
