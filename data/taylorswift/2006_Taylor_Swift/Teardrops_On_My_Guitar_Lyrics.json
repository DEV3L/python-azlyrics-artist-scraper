  "lyrics": "Drew looks at me.\nI fake a smile so he won't see\nThat I want and I'm needing\nEverything that we should be.\nI'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about,\nAnd she's got everything that I have to live without.\nDrew talks to me.\nI laugh 'cause it's just so funny\nThat I can't even see\nAnyone when he's with me.\nHe says he's so in love, he's finally got it right.\nI wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night.\nHe's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.\nThe only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star.\nHe's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do.\nDrew walks by me.\nCan he tell that I can't breathe?\nAnd there he goes, so perfectly.\nThe kind of flawless I wish I could be.\nShe better hold him tight, give him all her love,\nLook in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause\nHe's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.\nThe only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star.\nHe's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do.\nSo, I drive home alone.\nAs I turn out the light\nI'll put his picture down\nAnd maybe get some sleep tonight.\n'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.\nThe only one who's got enough of me to break my heart.\nHe's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do.\nHe's the time taken up, but there's never enough.\nAnd he's all that I need to fall into.\nDrew looks at me.\nI fake a smile so he won't see.",
