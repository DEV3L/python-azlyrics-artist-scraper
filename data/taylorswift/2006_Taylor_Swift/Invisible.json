{"lyrics": "She can\u2019t see the way your eyes\nLight up when you smile.\nShe\u2019ll never notice how you stop and stare\nWhenever she walks by.\nAnd you can\u2019t see me wantin' you the way you want her\nBut you are everything to me.\n[Chorus:]\nI just wanna show you\nShe don\u2019t even know you,\nShe's never gonna love you like I want to.\nAnd you just see right through me.\nIf you only knew me\nWe could be a beautiful\nMiracle,\nUnbelievable\nInstead of just invisible.\nThere\u2019s a fire inside of you\nThat can\u2019t help but shine through.\nShe\u2019s never gonna see the light\nNo matter what you do.\nAnd all I think about is how to make you think of me\nAnd everything that we could be\n[Chorus]\nLike shadows in a faded light\nOh, we\u2019re invisible.\nI just wanna open your eyes\nAnd make you realize.\nI just wanna show you\nShe don\u2019t even know you.\nBaby, let me love you,\nLet me want you.\nYou just see right through me\nBut if you only knew me\nWe could be a beautiful\nMiracle,\nUnbelievable\nInstead of just invisible.\nShe can\u2019t see the way your eyes\nLight up when you smile.", "title": "Invisible", "album": "Taylor Swift", "year": "2006"}
