{"lyrics": "\"A Place In This World\"\nI don't know what I want, so don't ask me\nCause I'm still trying to figure it out\nDon't know what's down this road, I'm just walking\nTrying to see through the rain coming down\nEven though I'm not the only one\nWho feels the way I do\n[Chorus:]\nI'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know\nI'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on\nOh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world\nGot the radio on, my old blue jeans\nAnd I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve\nFeeling lucky today, got the sunshine\nCould you tell me what more do I need\nAnd tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah\nBut that's ok\n[Chorus]\nMaybe I'm just a girl on a mission\nBut I'm ready to fly\nI'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know\nI'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on\nOh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know\nOh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world\nOh I'm just a girl\nOh I'm just a girl, oh, oh,\nOh I'm just a girl", "title": "A Place In This World", "year": "2006", "album": "Taylor Swift"}
