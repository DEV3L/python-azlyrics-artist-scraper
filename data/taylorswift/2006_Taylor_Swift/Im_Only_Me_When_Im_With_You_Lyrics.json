  "lyrics": "Friday night beneath the stars\nIn a field behind your yard.\nYou and I are paintin' pictures in the sky.\nAnd sometimes we don't say a thing;\nJust listen to the crickets sing.\nEverything I need is right here by my side.\nAnd I know everything about you\nI don't wanna live without you.\nI'm only up when you're not down.\nDon't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.\nIt's like no matter what I do.\nWell, you drive me crazy half the time;\nThe other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true.\nAnd I'm only me when I'm with you.\nJust a small town boy and girl\nLivin' in a crazy world.\nTryna figure out what is and isn't true.\nAnd I don't try to hide my tears,\nThe secrets or my deepest fears.\nThrough it all nobody gets me like you do.\nAnd you know everything about me.\nYou say that you can't live without me.\nI'm only up when you're not down.\nDon't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.\nIt's like no matter what I do.\nWell, you drive me crazy half the time;\nThe other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true.\nAnd I'm only me when I'm with you.\nWhen I'm with anybody else\nIt's so hard to be myself.\nAnd only you can tell...\n...That I'm only up when you're not down.\nDon't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.\nIt's like no matter what I do.\nWell, you drive me crazy half the time;\nThe other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true.\nAnd I'm only me\nWho I wanna be.\nWell, I'm only me when I'm with you,\nWith you.",
