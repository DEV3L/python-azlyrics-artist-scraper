  "lyrics": "I was riding shotgun\nWith my hair undone\nIn the front seat of his car\nHe's got a one-hand feel\nOn the steering wheel\nThe other on my heart\nI look around, turn the radio down\nHe says, \"Baby is something wrong?\"\nI say, \"Nothing.\nI was just thinking\nHow we don't have a song.\"\nAnd he says...\n[Chorus:]\nOur song is the slamming screen door,\nSneakin' out late, tapping on your window\nWhen we're on the phone and you talk real slow\n'Cause it's late and your mama don't know\nOur song is the way you laugh\nThe first date: \"Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have.\"\nAnd when I got home ... 'fore I said, \"Amen.\"\nAsking God if he could play it again\nI was walking up\nThe front porch steps\nAfter everything that day\nHad gone all wrong\nAnd been trampled on\nAnd lost and thrown away\nGot to the hallway,\nWell, on my way\nTo my lovin' bed\nI almost didn't notice\nAll the roses\nAnd the note that said,..\n[Chorus:]\nOur song is the slamming screen door,\nSneakin' out late, tapping on your window\nWhen we're on the phone and you talk real slow\n'Cause it's late and your mama don't know\nOur song is the way you laugh\nThe first date: \"Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have.\"\nAnd when I got home ... 'fore I said, \"Amen.\"\nAsking God if he could play it again\nI've heard every album, listened to the radio\nWaited for something to come along\nThat was as good as our song...\n[Chorus:]\n'Cause our song is the slamming screen door,\nSneakin' out late, tapping on his window\nWhen we're on the phone and he talks real slow\n'Cause it's late and his mama don't know\nOur song is the way he laughs\nThe first date: \"Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have.\"\nAnd when I got home ... 'fore I said, \"Amen.\"\nAsking God if he could play it again\nPlay it again\nOh, yeah...\nOh-oh, yeah.\nI was riding shotgun\nWith my hair undone\nIn the front seat of his car\nI grabbed a pen\nAnd an old napkin\nAnd I wrote down our song",
