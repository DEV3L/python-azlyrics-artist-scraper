  "lyrics": "You have a way of coming easily to me\nAnd when you take, you take the very best of me\nSo I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something\nAnd you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted\nOh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\nJust walk away, no use defending words that you will never say\nAnd now that I'm sitting here thinking it through\nI've never been anywhere cold as you\nYou put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray\nAnd I stood there loving you and wished them all away\nAnd you come away with a great little story\nOf a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you\nOh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\nSo, just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say\nAnd now that I'm sitting here thinking it through\nI've never been anywhere cold as you\nYou never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you\nAnd I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you\nOh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\nEvery smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made\nAnd now that I'm sitting here thinking it through\nI've never been anywhere cold as you",
