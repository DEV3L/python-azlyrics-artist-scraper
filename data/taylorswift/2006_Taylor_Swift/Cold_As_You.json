"{'album': 'Taylor Swift', 'title': 'Cold As You', 'lyrics': '\"Cold As You\"\\nYou have a way of coming easily to me\\r\\nAnd when you take, you take the very best of me\\r\\nSo I start a fight cause I need to feel something\\r\\nAnd you do what you want cause I\\'m not what you wanted\\n[Chorus:]\\nOh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\\r\\nJust walk away, no use defending words that you will never say\\r\\nAnd now that I\\'m sitting here thinking it through\\r\\nI\\'ve never been anywhere cold as you\\nYou put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray\\r\\nAnd I stood there loving you and wished them all away\\r\\nAnd you come away with a great little story\\r\\nOf a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you\\n[Repeat Chorus]\\nYou never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you\\r\\nAnd I know you wouldn\\'t have told nobody if I died, died for you\\r\\n(Died for you)\\nOh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\\r\\nEvery smile you fake is so condescending\\r\\nCounting all the scars you made\\r\\nAnd now that I\\'m sitting here thinking it through\\r\\nI\\'ve never been anywhere cold as you', 'year': '2006'}"
