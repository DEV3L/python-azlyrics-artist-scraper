  "lyrics": "She can't see the way your eyes\nLight up when you smile.\nShe'll never notice how you stop and stare\nWhenever she walks by.\nAnd you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her,\nBut you are everything to me.\nAnd I just wanna show you\nShe don't even know you,\nShe's never gonna love you like I want to.\nAnd you just see right through me,\nBut if you only knew me,\nWe could be a beautiful\nMiracle,\nUnbelievable\nInstead of just invisible.\nThere's a fire inside of you\nThat can't help but shine through.\nShe's never gonna see the light,\nNo matter what you do.\nAnd all I think about is how to make you think of me,\nAnd everything that we could be.\nI just wanna show you\nShe don't even know you,\nShe's never gonna love you like I want to.\nAnd you just see right through me,\nBut if you only knew me\nWe could be a beautiful\nMiracle,\nUnbelievable\nInstead of just invisible.\nLike shadows in a faded light.\nOh, we're invisible.\nI just wanna open your eyes,\nAnd make you realize.\nI just wanna show you\nShe don't even know you.\nBaby, let me love you,\nLet me want you.\nYou just see right through me,\nBut if you only knew me\nWe could be a beautiful\nMiracle,\nUnbelievable\nInstead of just invisible.\nShe can't see the way your eyes\nLight up when you smile.",
