{"lyrics": "\"The Outside\"\nI didn't know what I would find\r\nWhen I went looking for a reason, I know\r\nI didn't read between the lines\r\nAnd, baby, I've got nowhere to go\r\nI tried to take the road less traveled by\r\nBut nothing seems to work the first few times\r\nAm I right?\n[Chorus:]\nSo how can I ever try to be better?\r\nNobody ever lets me in\r\nI can still see you, this ain't the best view\r\nOn the outside looking in\r\nI've been a lot of lonely places\r\nI've never been on the outside\nYou saw me there, but never knew\r\nI would give it all up to be\r\nA part of this, a part of you\r\nAnd now it's all too late so you see\r\nYou could've helped if you had wanted to\r\nBut no one notices until it's too\r\nLate to do anything\n[Repeat Chorus]\nSo how can I ever try to be better?\r\nNobody ever lets me in\r\nI can still see you, this ain't the best view\r\nOn the outside looking in\r\nI've been a lot of lonely places\r\nI've never been on the outside", "title": "The Outside", "year": "2006", "album": "Taylor Swift"}
