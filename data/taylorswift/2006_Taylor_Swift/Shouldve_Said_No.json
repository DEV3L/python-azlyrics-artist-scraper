{"lyrics": "It's strange to think the songs we used to sing\nThe smiles, the flowers, everything is gone\nYesterday I found out about you\nEven now just looking at you feels wrong\nYou say that you'd take it all back, given one chance\nIt was a moment of weakness and you said, \"Yes.\"\n[Chorus:]\nYou should've said \"No\", you should've gone home\nYou should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go\nYou should've known that word, with what you did with her,\nGet back to me (get back to me).\nAnd I should've been there in the back of your mind\nI shouldn't be asking myself, \"Why?\"\nYou shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...\nYou should've said \"No\", baby, and you might still have me\nYou can see that I've been crying\nBaby, you know all the right things to say\nBut do you honestly expect me to believe\nWe could ever be the same?\nYou say that the past is the past, you need one chance\nIt was a moment of weakness and you said, \"Yes.\"\n[Chorus]\nI can't resist\nBefore you go, tell me this:\nWas it worth it?\nWas she worth this?\nNo... no, no, no...\n[Chorus]", "title": "Should've Said No", "album": "Taylor Swift", "year": "2006"}
