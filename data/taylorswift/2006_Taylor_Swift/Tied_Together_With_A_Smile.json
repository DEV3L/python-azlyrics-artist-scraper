"{'album': 'Taylor Swift', 'title': 'Tied Together With A Smile', 'lyrics': '\"Tied Together With A Smile\"\\nSeems the only one who doesn\\'t see your beauty\\nIs the face in the mirror looking back at you\\nYou walk around here thinking you\\'re not pretty\\nBut that\\'s not true, cause I know you...\\n[Chorus:]\\nHold on, baby, you\\'re losing it\\nThe water\\'s high, you\\'re jumping into it\\nAnd letting go... and no one knows\\nThat you cry, but you don\\'t tell anyone\\nThat you might not be the golden one\\nAnd you\\'re tied together with a smile\\nBut you\\'re coming undone\\nI guess it\\'s true that love was all you wanted\\nCause you\\'re giving it away like it\\'s extra change\\nHoping it will end up in his pocket\\nBut he leaves you out like a penny in the rain\\nOh, cause it\\'s not his price to pay\\nNot his price to pay...\\n[Chorus x2]\\nYou\\'re tied together with a smile\\nBut you\\'re coming undone... oh\\nGoodbye, baby\\nWith a smile, baby, baby', 'year': '2006'}"
