{"lyrics": "Cory's eyes are like a jungle\nHe smiles, it's like the radio\nHe whispers songs into my window\nIn words that nobody knows\nThere's pretty girls on every corner\nThat watch him as he's walking home\nSaying, \"Does he know?\"\nWill you ever know?\n[Chorus:]\nYou're beautiful\nEvery little piece love,\nAnd don't you know\nYou're really gonna be someone,\nAsk anyone.\nAnd when you find everything you looked for\nI hope your life lead you back to my door\nOh, but if it don't,\nStay beautiful\nCory finds another way to be\nThe highlight of my day\nI'm taking pictures in my mind\nSo I can save them for a rainy day\nIt's hard to make a conversation\nWhen he's taking my breath away\nI should say, hey, by the way...\n[Chorus]\nIf you and I are a story\nThat never gets told\nIf what you are is a daydream\nI'll never get to hold,\nAt least you'll know...\nYou're beautiful\nEvery little piece love,\nAnd don't you know\nYou're really gonna be someone,\nAsk anyone.\nAnd when you find everything you looked for,\nI hope your life lead you back to my front door.\nOh, but if it don't\nWill you stay\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful\nLa la la\nOh, oh, oh, oh,\nOh, but if it don't,\nStay beautiful\nStay beautiful\nNa, na, na, na, na", "title": "Stay Beautiful", "album": "Taylor Swift", "year": "2006"}
