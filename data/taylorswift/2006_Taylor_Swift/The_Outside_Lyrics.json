  "lyrics": "I didn't know what I would find\nWhen I went looking for a reason,\nI know I didn't read between the lines\nAnd, baby, I've got nowhere to go\nI tried to take the road less traveled by\nBut nothing seems to work the first few times\nAm I right?\nSo how can I ever try to be better?\nNobody ever lets me in\nI can still see you.\nThis ain't the best view\nOn the outside looking in\nAnd I've been a lot of lonely places\nI've never been on the outside\nYou saw me there, but never knew\nThat I would give it all up to be\nA part of this, a part of you.\nAnd now it's all too late. So you see...\nYou could've helped if you had wanted to\nBut no one notices until it's too late to do anything\nSo how can I ever try to be better?\nNobody ever lets me in\nI can still see you.\nThis ain't the best view\nOn the outside looking in\nAnd I've been a lot of lonely places\nI've never been on the outside\nOh, yeah\nSo how can I ever try to be better?\nNobody ever lets me in\nAnd I can still see you.\nThis ain't the best view\nOn the outside looking in\nAnd I've been a lot of lonely places\nI've never been on the outside",
