  "lyrics": "There's glitter on the floor after the party\nGirls carrying their shoes down in the lobby\nCandle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor\nYou and me from the night before, but\nDon't read the last page\nBut I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared\nAnd you're turning away\nI want your midnights\nBut I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day\nYou squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi\nI can tell that it's gonna be a long road\nI'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe\nOr if you strike out and you're crawling home\nDon't read the last page\nBut I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong\nOr we're making mistakes\nI want your midnights\nBut I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day\nHold on to the memories, they will hold on to you\nHold on to the memories, they will hold on to you\nHold on to the memories, they will hold on to you\nAnd I will hold on to you\nPlease don't ever become a stranger\nWhose laugh I could recognize anywhere\nPlease don't ever become a stranger\nWhose laugh I could recognize anywhere\nThere's glitter on the floor after the party\nGirls carrying their shoes down in the lobby\nCandle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor\nYou and me forevermore\nDon't read the last page\nBut I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong\nOr we're making mistakes\nI want your midnights\nBut I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day\nHold on to the memories, they will hold on to you\nHold on to the memories, they will hold on to you\nHold on to the memories, they will hold on to you\nAnd I will hold on to you\nPlease don't ever become a stranger\nWhose laugh I could recognize anywhere\nPlease don't ever become a stranger\nWhose laugh I could recognize anywhere",
