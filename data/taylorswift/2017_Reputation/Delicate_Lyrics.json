Isn't it? Isn't it?\nIsn't it?\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\nIsn't it?\nDelicate\nThird floor on the west side, me and you\nHandsome, you're a mansion with a view\nDo the girls back home touch you like I do?\nLong night, with your hands up in my hair\nEchoes of your footsteps on the stairs\nStay here, honey, I don't wanna share\n'Cause I like you\nThis ain't for the best\nMy reputation's never been worse, so\nYou must like me for me\nYeah, I want you\nWe can't make\nAny promises now, can we, babe?\nBut you can make me a drink\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)\nIs it cool that I said all that\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\nIsn't it?\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\nIsn't it?\nDelicate\nSometimes I wonder when you sleep\nAre you ever dreaming of me?\nSometimes when I look into your eyes\nI pretend you're mine, all the damn time\n'Cause I like you\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)\nYeah, I want you\nIs it cool that I said all that\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)\n'Cause I like you\nIs it cool that I said all that?\n(Isn't it?)\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n(Isn't it? Isn't it?)\n'Cause I know that it's delicate\n(Isn't it?)\n(Delicate)\nYeah, I want you\nIs it cool that I said all that\n(Isn't it?)\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n(Isn't it? Isn't it?)\n'Cause I know that it's delicate\n(Isn't it?)\nDelicate",
