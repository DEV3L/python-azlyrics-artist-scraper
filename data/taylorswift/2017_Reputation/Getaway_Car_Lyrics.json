  "lyrics": "No, nothing good starts in a getaway car...\nIt was the best of times, the worst of crimes\nI struck a match and blew your mind\nBut I didn't mean it\nAnd you didn't see it\nThe ties were black, the lies were white\nIn shades of gray and candlelight\nI wanted to leave him\nI needed a reason\nX marks the spot, where we fell apart\nHe poisoned the well, I was lying to myself\nI knew it from the first old fashioned, we were cursed\nWe never had a shotgun shot in the dark\nYou were driving the getaway car\nWe were flying, but we'd never get far\nDon't pretend it's such a mystery\nThink about the place where you first met me\nWe're riding in a getaway car\nThere were sirens in the beat of your heart\nShould've known I'd be the first to leave\nThink about the place where you first met me\nIn a getaway car\nNo, they never get far\nNo, nothing good starts in a getaway car\nIt was the great escape, the prison break\nThe light of freedom on my face\nBut you weren't thinking\nAnd I was just drinking\nWell he was running after us, I was screaming 'Go go go!'\nBut with three of us, honey, it's a side show\nAnd a circus ain't a love story\nAnd now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)\nX marks the spot, where we fell apart\nHe poisoned the well, every man for himself\nI knew it from the first old fashioned, we were cursed\nIt hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart\nYou were driving the getaway car\nWe were flying, but we'd never get far\nDon't pretend it's such a mystery\nThink about the place where you first met me\nWe're riding in a getaway car\nThere were sirens in the beat of your heart\nShould've known I'd be the first to leave\nThink about the place where you first met me\nIn a getaway car\nNo, they never get far\nNo, nothing good starts in a getaway car\nWe were jet set Bonnie and Clyde\nUntil I switched to the other side\nIt's no surprise, I turned you in\n'Cause us traitors never win\nI'm in a getaway car\nI left you in the motel bar\nI put the money in a bag and stole the keys\nThat was the last time you ever saw me\nDriving the getaway car\nWe were flying, but we'd never get far\nDon't pretend it's such a mystery\nThink about the place where you first met me\nWe're riding in a getaway car\nThere were sirens in the beat of your heart\nShould've known I'd be the first to leave\nThink about the place where you first met me\nIn a getaway car\nNo, they never get far\nNo, nothing good starts in a getaway car\nI was riding in a getaway car\nI was crying in a getaway car\nI was dying in a getaway car\nSaid 'goodbye' in a getaway car\nI was riding in a getaway car\nI was crying in a getaway car\nI was dying in a getaway car\nSaid 'goodbye' in a getaway car",
