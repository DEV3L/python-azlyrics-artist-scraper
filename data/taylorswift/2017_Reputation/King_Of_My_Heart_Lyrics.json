  "lyrics": "I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own\nI made up my mind, I'm better off being alone\nWe met a few weeks ago\nNow you try on calling me, baby, like trying on clothes\nSalute to me I'm your American Queen\nAnd you move to me like I'm a Motown beat\nAnd we rule the kingdom inside my room\n'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars\nWith their Range Rovers and their Jaguars\nNever took me quite where you do\nAnd all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for\nKing of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa\nAnd all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go\nKing of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa\nAnd all at once, I've been waiting, waiting\nOoh whoa, ooh whoa\nAnd all at once, you are the one I have been waiting, waiting\nBody and soul, ooh whoa\nAnd all at once\nLate in the night, the city's asleep\nYour love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep\nChange my priorities\nThe taste of your lips is my idea of luxury\nSalute to me I'm your American Queen\nAnd you move to me like I'm a Motown beat\nAnd we rule the kingdom inside my room\n'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars\nWith their Range Rovers and their Jaguars\nNever took me quite where you do\nAnd all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for\nKing of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa\nAnd all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go\nKing of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa\nAnd all at once, I've been waiting, waiting\nOoh whoa, ooh whoa\nAnd all at once, you are the one I have been waiting, waiting\nBody and soul, ooh whoa\nAnd all at once\nIs this the end of all the endings?\nMy broken bones are mending\nWith all these nights we're spending\nUp on the roof with a school girl crush\nDrinking beer out of plastic cups\nSay you fancy me, not fancy stuff\nBaby, all at once, this is enough\nAnd all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for\nKing of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa\nAnd all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for\nKing of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa\nAnd all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go\nKing of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa\nAnd all at once, I've been waiting, waiting\nOoh whoa, ooh whoa\nAnd all at once, you are the one I have been waiting, waiting\nBody and soul, ooh whoa\nAnd all at once",
