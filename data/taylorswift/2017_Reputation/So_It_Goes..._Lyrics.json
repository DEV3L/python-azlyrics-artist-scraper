  "lyrics": "See you in the dark\nAll eyes on you, my magician\nAll eyes on us\nYou make everyone disappear, and\nCut me into pieces\nGold cage, hostage to my feelings\nBack against the wall\nTrippin', trip, trippin' when you're gone\n'Cause we break down a little\nBut when you get me alone, it's so simple\n'Cause baby, I know what you know\nWe can feel it...\nAnd all the pieces fall\nRight into place\nGetting caught up in a moment\nLipstick on your face\nSo it goes...\nI'm yours to keep\nAnd I'm yours to lose\nYou know I'm not a bad girl, but I\nDo bad things with you\nSo it goes...\nMet you in a bar\nAll eyes on me, your illusionist\nAll eyes on us\nI make all your grey days clear and\nWear you like a necklace\nI'm so chill, but you make me jealous\nBut I got your heart\nSkippin', skip, skippin' when I'm gone\n'Cause we break down a little\nBut when I get you alone, it's so simple\n'Cause baby, I know what you know\nWe can feel it...\nAnd all the pieces fall\nRight into place\nGetting caught up in a moment\nLipstick on your face\nSo it goes...\nI'm yours to keep\nAnd I'm yours to lose\nYou know I'm not a bad girl, but I\nDo bad things with you\nSo it goes...\nCome here, dressed in black now\nSo, so, so it goes...\nScratches down your back now\nSo, so, so it goes...\nYou did a number on me\nBut, honestly, baby, who's counting?\nI did a number on you\nBut, honestly, baby, who's counting?\nYou did a number on me\nBut, honestly, baby, who's counting?\nWho's counting?\n1, 2, 3\nAnd all the pieces fall (pieces fall)\nRight into place\nGetting caught up in a moment (caught up, caught up)\nLipstick on your face\nSo it goes...\nI'm yours to keep (oh)\nAnd I'm yours to lose (baby)\nYou know I'm not a bad girl, but I\nDo bad things with you\nSo it goes...\nCome here, dressed in black now\nSo, so, so it goes...\nScratches down your back now\nSo, so, so it goes...\nCome here, dressed in black now\nSo, so, so it goes...\nScratches down your back now\nSo, so, so it goes...",
