  "lyrics": "I, I loved you in secret\nFirst sight, yeah, we love without reason\nOh, 25 years old\nOh, how were you to know and\nMy, my love had been frozen\nDeep blue, but you painted me golden\nOh, and you held me close\nOh, how was I to know what\nI could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets\nPicture of your face in an invisible locket\nYou said there was nothing in the world that could stop it\nI had a bad feeling\nAnd darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis\nPeople started talking, putting us through our paces\nI knew there was no one in the world who could take it\nI had a bad feeling\nBut we were dancing\nDancing with our hands tied, hands tied\nYeah, we were dancing\nLike it was the first time, first time\nYeah, we were dancing\nDancing with our hands tied, hands tied\nYeah, we were dancing\nAnd I had a bad feeling\nBut we were dancing\nI, I loved you in spite of\nDeep fears that the world would divide us\nSo, baby, can we dance\nOh, through an avalanche?\nAnd say, say that we got it\nI'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted\nOh, 'cause it's gravity\nOh, keeping you with me\nI could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets\nPicture of your face in an invisible locket\nYou said there was nothing in the world that could stop it\nI had a bad feeling\nBut we were dancing\nDancing with our hands tied, hands tied\nYeah, we were dancing\nLike it was the first time, first time\nYeah, we were dancing\nDancing with our hands tied, hands tied\nYeah, we were dancing\n(Ooh, we had our hands tied)\nAnd I had a bad feeling\nBut we were dancing\nI'd kiss you as the lights went out\nSwaying as the room burned down\nI'd hold you as the water rushes in\nIf I could dance with you again\nI'd kiss you as the lights went out\nSwaying as the room burned down\nI'd hold you as the water rushes in\nIf I could dance with you again\nDancing with our hands tied, hands tied\nYeah, we were dancing\nLike it was the first time, first time\nYeah, we were dancing\nDancing with our hands tied, hands tied\nYeah, we were dancing\nAnd I had a bad feeling\nBut we were dancing\nHands tied, hands tied",
