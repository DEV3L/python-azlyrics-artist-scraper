  "lyrics": "Knew he was a killer\nFirst time that I saw him\nWonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted\nBut if he's a ghost then I can be a phantom\nHoldin' him for ransom\nSome, some boys are tryin' too hard\nHe don't try at all though\nYounger than my exes but he act like such a man, so\nI see nothing better, I keep him forever\nLike a vendetta-ta\nI-I-I see how this is gonna go\nTouch me, and you'll never be alone\nI-Island breeze and lights down low\nNo one has to know\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams\nYou should see the things we do, baby\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams\nI know I'm gonna be with you\nSo I take my time\n(Are you ready for it?)\nKnew I was a robber\nFirst time that he saw me\nStealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry\nBut if I'm a thief then\nHe can join the heist\nAnd we'll move to an island-and\nAnd he can be my jailer\nBurton to this Taylor\nEvery love I've known in comparison is a failure\nI forget their names now\nI'm so very tame now\nNever be the same now, now\nI-I-I see how this is gonna go\nTouch me and you'll never be alone\nI-Island breeze and lights down low\nNo one has to know\n(No one has to know)\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams\nYou should see the things we do, baby\nIn the middle of the night in my dreams\nI know I'm gonna be with you\nSo I take my time\n(Are you ready for it?)\n(Ooh, are you ready for it?)\nBaby, let the games begin\nLet the games begin\nLet the games begin\nBaby, let the games begin\nLet the games begin\nLet the games begin\nI-I-I see how this is gonna go\nTouch me and you'll never be alone\nI-Island breeze and lights down low\nNo one has to know\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams\nYou should see the things we do, baby\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams\nI know I'm gonna be with you\nSo I take my time\nIn the middle of the night\nBaby, let the games begin\nLet the games begin\nLet the games begin\n(Are you ready for it?)\nBaby, let the games begin\nLet the games begin\nLet the games begin\n(Are you ready for it?)",
