  "lyrics": "Our secret moments\nIn a crowded room\nThey got no idea\nAbout me and you\nThere is an indentation\nIn the shape of you\nMade your mark on me\nA golden tattoo\nAll of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation\nMy hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)\nAll of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting\nMy hands are shaking from all this (ha, ha, ha, ha)\nSay my name and everything just stops\nI don't want you like a best friend\nOnly bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)\nCarve your name into my bedpost\nCause I don't want you like a best friend\nOnly bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)\nInescapable\nI'm not even going to try\nAnd if I get burned, at least we were electrified\nI'm spilling wine in the bathtub\nYou kiss my face and we're both drunk\nEveryone thinks that they know us\nBut they know nothing about\nAll of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation\nMy hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)\nAll of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting\nMy hands are shaking from all this (ah, ha, ha, ha)\nSay my name and everything just stops\nI don't want you like a best friend\nOnly bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)\nCarve your name into my bedpost\nCause I don't want you like a best friend\nOnly bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)...\nOnly bought this dress so you could take it off (ha, ha, ha)...\nOnly bought this dress so you could take it off (ha, ha, ha)...\nFlashback when you met me\nYour buzz cut and my hair bleached\nEven in my worst times, you could see the best of me\nFlashback to my mistakes\nMy rebounds, my earthquakes\nEven in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me\nAnd I woke up just in time\nNow I wake up by your side\nMy one and only, my lifeline\nI woke up just in time\nNow I wake up by your side\nMy hands shake, I can't explain this\nAha, ha, ha, ha\nSay my name and everything just stops\nI don't want you like a best friend\nOnly bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)\nCarve your name into my bedpost\nCause I don't want you like a best friend\nOnly bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)\nThere is an indentation\nIn the shape of you\nOnly bought this dress so you could take it off\nYou made your mark on me, golden tattoo\nOnly bought this dress so you could take it off",
