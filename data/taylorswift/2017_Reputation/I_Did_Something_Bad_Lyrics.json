  "lyrics": "I never trust a narcissist, but they love me\nSo I play 'em like a violin\nAnd I make it look oh-so-easy\n'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three\nThis is how the world works\nNow all he thinks about is me\nI can feel the flames on my skin\nCrimson red paint on my lips\nIf a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing\nI don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming\nThey say I did something bad\nThen why's it feel so good?\nThey say I did something bad\nBut why's it feel so good?\nMost fun I ever had\nAnd I'd do it over and over and over again if I could\nIt just felt so good, good\nI never trust a playboy, but they love me\nSo I fly 'em all around the world\nAnd I let them think they saved me\nThey never see it comin', what I do next\nThis is how the world works\nYou gotta leave before you get left\nI can feel the flames on my skin\nHe says, \"Don't throw away a good thing\"\nBut if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'\nAnd if he spends my change, then he had it comin'\nThey say I did something bad\nThen why's it feel so good?\nThey say I did something bad\nBut why's it feel so good?\nMost fun I ever had\nAnd I'd do it over and over and over again if I could\nIt just felt so good, good\nThey're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one\nThey got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons\nThey're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one\nSo light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)\nLight me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)\nLight me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)\nLight me up (light me up), light me up\nThey say I did something bad (oh)\nThen why's it feel so good? (so good)\nThey say I did something bad\nBut why's it feel so good?\nMost fun I ever had (most fun I ever had)\nAnd I'd do it over and over and over again if I could\nIt just felt so good (good), good\nOh, you say I did something bad\n(You say I did something bad?)\nWhy's it feel so good, good?\nSo bad, why's it feel so good?\nWhy's it feel, why's it feel so good? (bad)\nIt just felt so good, good",
