  "lyrics": "Gorgeous\nYou should take it as a compliment\nThat I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk\nYou should think about the consequence\nOf your magnetic field being a little too strong\nAnd I got a boyfriend, he's older than us\nHe's in the club doing, I don't know what\nYou're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)\nWhisky on ice, Sunset and Vine\nYou've ruined my life, by not being mine\nYou're so gorgeous\nI can't say anything to your face\n'Cause look at your face\nAnd I'm so furious\nAt you for making me feel this way\nBut what can I say?\nYou're gorgeous\nYou should take it as a compliment\nThat I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)\nAnd you should think about the consequence\nOf you touching my hand in a darkened room (dark room, dark room)\nIf you got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her\nBut if you're single that's honestly worse\n'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts\n(Honey, it hurts)\nOcean blue eyes looking in mine\nI feel like I might sink and drown and die\nYou're so gorgeous\nI can't say anything to your face\n'Cause look at your face\nAnd I'm so furious\nAt you for making me feel this way\nBut what can I say?\nYou're gorgeous\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad\nThere's nothing I hate more than what I can't have\nYou are so gorgeous it makes me so mad\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad\nThere's nothing I hate more than what I can't have\nGuess I'll just stumble on home to my cats\nAlone, unless you wanna come along, oh...\nYou're so gorgeous\nI can't say anything to your face\n'Cause look at your face\nAnd I'm so furious\nAt you for making me feel this way\nBut what can I say?\nYou're gorgeous\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad\nThere's nothing I hate more than what I can't have\nYou are so gorgeous it makes me so mad\nYou're gorgeous\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad\nThere's nothing I hate more than what I can't have\nYou are so gorgeous it makes me so mad\nYou're gorgeous",
