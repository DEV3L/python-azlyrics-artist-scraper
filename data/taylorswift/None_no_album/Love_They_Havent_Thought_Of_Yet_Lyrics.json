  "lyrics": "I want it all to appear before my eyes when he smiles\nMaybe I'm wrong but I don't think Romeo would be my kind of guy\nI want a love that's sweeter than roses\nAnd for me this is how it's gonna be\nLike there's a fairytale guy\nAnd he whispers sweet lullabies\nAnd the music plays from nowhere\nAs we dance in the pale moonlight\nWith candles and fireflies all night\nEverybody thinks about love\nI want love they haven't thought of yet\nHere on the couch with a box of chocolates that I bought myself\nI'll wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help\nIt's what you get when your heartstrings are so tied\nI don't regret it 'cause it needs to be perfect\nLike there's a fairytale guy\nAnd he whispers sweet lullabies\nAnd he music plays from nowhere\nAs we dance in the pale moonlight\nWith candles and fireflies all night\nEverybody thinks about love\nI want love they haven't thought of yet\nI want my own little storybook ending\nWe'll make it up as we go\nThere's a fairytale guy\nAnd he whispers sweet lullabies\nAnd the music plays from nowhere\nAs we dance in the pale moonlight\nWith candles and fireflies all night\nEverybody thinks about love\nI want love they haven't thought of yet\nI want love they haven't thought of yet",
