  "lyrics": "Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him\nWondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted\nBut if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom\nHoldin' him for ransom, some\nSome boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though\nYounger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so\nI see nothing better, I keep him forever\nLike a vendetta-ta\nI, I, I see how this is gon' go\nTouch me and you'll never be alone\nI-Island breeze and lights down low\nNo one has to know\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams\nYou should see the things we do, baby\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams\nI know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time\nAre you ready for it?\nKnew I was a robber first time that he saw me\nStealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry\nBut if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and\nWe'll move to an island, and\nAnd he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor\nEvery love I've known in comparison is a failure\nI forget their names now, I'm so very tame now\nNever be the same now, now\nI, I, I see how this is gon' go\nTouch me and you'll never be alone\nI-Island breeze and lights down low\nNo one has to know (no one has to know)\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams (Night, in my dreams)\nYou should see the things we do, baby (We'd do, baby)\nIn the middle of the night in my dreams (My dreams)\nI know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time\nAre you ready for it?\nNight, in my dreams\nWe'd do, baby\nYeah, in the middle of the night\nBaby, let the games begin\nLet the games begin\nLet the games begin\nBaby, let the games begin\nLet the games begin\nLet the games begin\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams\nYou should see the things we do, baby",
