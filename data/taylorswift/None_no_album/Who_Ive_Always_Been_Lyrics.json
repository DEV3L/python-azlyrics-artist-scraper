  "lyrics": "You walk in here with your guitar man\nYour shining boots and your full on band\nA smile on your face, a knife in your hand\nSinging songs you've got memorized\nWith whatever talent money buys\nSo polished that it slips right through your hands\nBut don't ruin yourself I ain't your competition\nDon't flatter yourself that was never my intention\nI wanna talk about what you are that I ain't\nLet's talk about what you do that I can't\nLet's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins\nLet's talk about what you did to get here\nLet's talk about blood and sweat and tears\nLet's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been\nI walk in here with a beat up case\nThe same guitar I've always played\nAnd the words i wrote down on a page,\nWhen i was 12 years old a small town raised\nYou tell the crowd you're paying dues,\nI tell them, \"this is what I do\"\nAnd it\u2019s what i put my life into,\nAs I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume\nAnd say life on musical road is rough conditions\nBut the easy ride was never my ambition\nI wanna talk about what you are that I ain't\nLet's talk about what you do that I can't\nLet's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins\nLet's talk about what you did to get here\nLet's talk about blood and sweat and tears\nLet's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been\nLet's talk about your childhood days\nYou were the prom queen, I was on this stage\nSo where's that crown gotten you these days?\nWhen it's me and you and the same damn games\nSo what have you got that I ain't?\nAnd what can you do that I can't?\nLet's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins\nLet's talk about what you did to get here\nLet's talk about blood and sweat and tears\nLet's talk about what you wanna be, girl, and who I've always been",
