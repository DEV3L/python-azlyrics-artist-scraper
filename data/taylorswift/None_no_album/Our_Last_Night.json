{"lyrics": "(originally by Better Than Ezra)\nOh\nWe were standing in an empty room\nThe moonlight was fallin'\nYou were holdin' my hand when the car pulled up for you\nAnd I coulda spent a life with you\nBut those days are over\nYou were callin my name \nWhen your face faded from view\nWasn't it you that told me?\nThe sun would always chase the day\nWasn't it you that told me?\nAngels fly, in the air tonight\nSaying wasn't it just like swimmin\" out on the lake?\nStars collide in the air so light\nOr was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night\nOh\nI remember waking up with you\nThe days doin' nothin'\nYou meant more to me then, than you ever knew\nYou were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar\nHope the the world never tore that out of you\nWasn't it you that told me?\nThe sun would always chase the day\nWasn't it you that told me?\nAngels fly in the air tonight\nSaying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake?\nAnd stars collide in the air so light\nOr was it just like those promises you made on Our last night?\nTell me whatever happened to the things you loved?\nAnd the songs we played and the indian days\nWhatever happened to the things you gave away?\nLike harold and martin singing\nI was waving as you drove away\nThe sunlight was falling\nYou were riding backwards in a dusty window pane\nAngels fly in the air tonight\nWas it just like the promises that we made?\nAnd stars collide in the air so light\nWas it just like those promises that you made?\nOn our last night\nOn our last night \nOh,oh,oh,whoa,whoa,yeaah, oh", "title": "Our Last Night", "album": null, "year": null}
