{"lyrics": "Here in my mind the sky looks the same\nOn every day you loved me \nWhen we started home it started to rain \nYou put your coat around me \nWe stood there in the road \nYou held me so close \nBut did you ever let go \nDown came the rain \nLightning and thunder \nWe tried in vain \nTo hold on to each other \nWinds of change blew you away from me \nRight here right now, I feel it on my skin \nThe bitter sting of what we could\u2019ve been \nJust when our love was like a burning flame \nDown came the rain \nIn through the window I see her with you \nI\u2019m soaked to the skin, you\u2019re warm and dry \nI guess the storm is over for you \nBut look at the tears here in my eyes \nI just stood there like a ghost \nAs you held her so close \nAnd as I let you go \nDown came the rain \nLightning and thunder \nWe tried in vain \nTo hold on to each other \nWinds of change blew you away from me \nLove like this changes who you are \nEvery kiss you gave me is a scar \nJust when our love was like a burning flame \nDown came the rain \nAll I need is to move on fast \nBut all I want is to have you back \nAnd it just keeps falling\u2026 \nDown came the rain \nLightning and thunder \nWe tried in vain \nTo hold on to each other \nWinds of change blew you away from me \nRight here right now, I feel it on my skin \nThe bitter sting of what we could\u2019ve been \nJust when our love was like a burning flame \nDown came the rain \nDown came the rain", "title": "Down Came The Rain", "album": null, "year": null}
