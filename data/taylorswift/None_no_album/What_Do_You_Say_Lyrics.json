  "lyrics": "What do you say, when you just know\nThat he's the one, and you wanna go fast\nBut he's taking it slow\nAnd what do you do, when he's next to you\nBut he's a little bit shy\nWell here's something you can try\nHey, hey what do you say\nWe go walking down the river all together\nIt's a warm May beautiful day\nAnd I feel like I could\nTalk to you forever\nWith the sun shining bright\nIt feels just like a day\nWhen everything's gonna go just right\nI know it will be a sweet memory\nFor you and me someday\nWhat do you say?\nWhat do you see, when you look in his eyes\nThere's something there\nThat he can't disguise\nNo matter how he tries\nAnd what do you feel, when you know its real\nAnd you can't sit still\nIf you don't own up will yeah\nHey, hey what do you say\nWe go walking down the river all together\nIt's a warm May beautiful day\nAnd I feel like I could\nTalk to you forever\nWith the sun shining bright\nIt feels just like a day\nWhen everything's gonna go just right\nI know it will be a sweet memory\nFor you and me someday\nWhat do you say?\nMy imagination's running away\nJust dreaming about\nWhat I want you to say\nHey, hey what do you say\nWe go walking down the river all together\nIt's a warm May beautiful day\nAnd I feel like I could\nTalk to you forever\nWith the sun shining bright\nIt feels just like a day\nWhen everything's gonna go just right\nI know it will be a sweet memory\nFor you and me someday\nWhat do you say?\nWhat do you say?\nWhat do you say?\nWhat do you say?",
