  "lyrics": "It was something like a perfect start to\nThis love yesterday but now who are you\nI thought I knew\nYour eyes how to know to look right through me\nIt's like you forgot the words you whispered to me\nThey weren't true\nIt's like it wasn't you\nCould you tell me what did I do\nBecause it can't be we're already through\nDid you sell me out for a fool\nAfter you held me is that just what you do\nWhat did you need from me\nTell me\nTake time to realize I know\nThat people change their minds\nBut that was something I wished you would say\nTo my face\nBut you run away\nCould you tell me what did I do\nBecause it can't be we're already through\nDid you sell me out for a fool\nAfter you held me is that just what you do\nWhat did you need from me\nTell me\nIf I had a reason or a simple goodbye\nBaby even a lie\nYeah Yeah\nTell me what did I do\nBecause baby suddenly we're already through\nDid you sell me out for a fool\nAfter you held me is that just what you do\nWhat did you need from me\nTell me\nAnd tell me\nOoooh Yeah\nTell me\nTell Me",
