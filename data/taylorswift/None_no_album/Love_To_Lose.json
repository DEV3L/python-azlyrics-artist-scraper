{"lyrics": "Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out\nSorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down\nWe were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me\nYou were the perfect view of misery\nI never talked about the tears I cried\nAll the sleepless nights or the endless fights\nI never talked about the days he called\nThere was something wrong, it was all my fault\nI had it all, what a shame, what a fall now\nBut in case you haven't heard the news\nThere wasn't much love to lose\nLet's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night\nHow was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside\nHe smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind\nAnd I lied, I swore that everything was fine\nI never talked about the tears I cried\nAll the sleepless nights or the endless fights\nI never talked about the nights he called\nThere was something wrong, it was all my fault\nI had it all, what a shame, what a fall now\nBut in case you haven't heard the news\nThere wasn't much love to lose\nI know you wanna talk about me\nHow I gave up on love so foolishly\nBut keep in mind\nI never talked about the tears I cried\nAll the sleepless nights or the endless fights\nI never talked about the nights he called\nThere was something wrong, it was all my fault\nI had it all, what a shame, what a fall now\nBut in case you haven't heard the news\nThere wasn't much love to lose\nCome on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out", "title": "Love To Lose", "album": null, "year": null}
