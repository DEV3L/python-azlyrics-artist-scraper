{"lyrics": "\"Smokey Black Nights\"\nLet's watch\nThe tide chase\nThe waves\nOnto the sand\nI wonder\nIf a broken heart\nFeel the warmth\nOn my hand\nAnd I wonder\nWhat a piece\nOf driftwood\nHas seen all through\nHis lifetime\nLet's walk away\nThe past through\nThe smokey black nights\nI've seen\nA million things\nSpoke a million words\nNow I only want\nTo speak to you\nWaiting for the words\nCounting every bird\nThere's nothing\nI'd rather do\nOn the\nSmokey black nights\nStill throught\nThe haze\nI can make out\nConstellations\nI'll make one\nOf you and me\nAs we sit\nIn the sand\nAnd I saw\nThat sunset gleamin\nAs my eyes went wild\nLet's walk away\nThe past through\nThe smokey black nights\nI've played\nA thousand songs\nSang a thousand words\nNow I only want\nTo sing to you\nWaited on a wire\nStarin' at the fire\nThere's nothing\nI'd rather do\nOn the\nSmokey black nights\nI've walked\nA thousand miles\nSmiled\nA thousand smiles\nNow I only smile\nWhen I'm with you\nWaiting for the words\nCounting every bird\nThere's nothing\nI'd rather do\nOn the\nSmokey black nights\nSo walk with me\nAs the sweet\nWind dances\nI'll write a song\nFor you and me\nOn the\nSmokey black nights", "title": "Smokey Black Nights", "year": null, "album": null}
