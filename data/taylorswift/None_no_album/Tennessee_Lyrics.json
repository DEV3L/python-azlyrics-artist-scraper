  "lyrics": "Standing on a street somewhere I don't wanna be\nIn a town that's made of stone\nSome bad directions must have me here by mistake\n'Cause this sure ain't what I call home\nLet me close my eyes for a second\nSee if I can get out of here, and\nLet my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun\nAnd watch a pickup truck drive by\nAnd I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here\nBut I don't, I just sit under this tree\nAnd I'm in Tennessee\nStanding on a road leading to a barn\nWith a cat named Eloise\nLater on, we'll all go fishing in the pond\nBut all we'll catch is just a summer breeze\nLet me close my eyes for a second\nSee if I can stay right here, and\nLet my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun\nAnd watch a pickup truck drive by\nAnd I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here\nBut I don't, I just sit under this tree\nAnd I'm in Tennessee\nWhen the pond is gone and Eloise floats away\nI find myself staring at the same old day\nI need to go back, back to where I feel so free\nWell, it looks like I'm going back to Tennessee\nI let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun\nAnd watch a pickup truck drive by\nAnd I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here\nBut I don't, I just sit under this tree\nJust me and Eloise\nAnd I'm in Tennessee",
