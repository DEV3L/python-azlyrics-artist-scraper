  "lyrics": "I could've keyed your car\nI could've rolled your yard\nI know the passwords to your emails, everything you do\nI could've put 'em to good use\nBut I'm dressed to kill and tonight I'm going out on a date\nWith your best friend, he always liked me anyway\nR-E-V-E-N-G-E My list of things to do this week\nJealousy, misery, gonna give you what you gave to me\nMake you feel so B-A-D\nBreak you, make you sorry\nI hope you cry getting my R-E-V-E-N-G-E\nSo I'm gonna paint the town with him\nReplace your memory, everywhere we've ever been\nI don't hangout at smokey bars but I know we'll see you there\nAnd I'm making you hear me laugh like I just don't care\nI know you hate my friends so tonight I called 'em all\nLater on you can expect some prank phone calls, baby\nR-E-V-E-N-G-E My list of things to do this week\nJealousy, misery, gonna give you what you gave to me\nMake you feel so B-A-D\nBreak you, make you sorry\nI hope you cry getting my R-E-V-E-N-G-E\nS-A-N-I-T-Y, I hope you lose yours tonight\nYou made me crazy too long\nSo I'm working on\nR-E-V-E-N-G-E My list of things to do this week\nJealousy, misery, gonna give you what you gave to me\nMake you feel so B-A-D\nBreak you, make you sorry\nI hope you cry getting my R-E-V-E-N-G-E\nBaby, baby R-E-V-E-N-G-E\nGonna give you what you gave to me",
