{"lyrics": "Your feet under the table\nI love it when they're touching mine\nYour hands make the crisps at the cradle\nTo tell me everything is fine\nAll I see is you looking at me\nDo you know when you go\nYou make the sweetest sight at the window\nIf you had never come out of the blue\nI would have stayed up and Made Up You\nYou smile just like a picture\nIt doesn't even need a frame\nSometimes I wait to answer\nJust to hear you say my name\nAnd all I want is just what I've got\nDo you know when you go \nYou make the sweetest sight at the window\nIf you had never come out of the blue\nI would have stayed up and Made Up You\nI'd never let you go\nEven If I could\nCause I never could've dreamed you up this good\nOh oh\nDo you know when you go\nYou make the sweetest sight at the window\nIf you had never come out of the blue\nI would have stayed up and Made Up You\nMade Up You\nOh oh\nMade Up You", "title": "Made Up You", "album": null, "year": null}
