I can't take it back, look where I'm at!\nWe was on D like DOC, remember that? (Remember that)\nMy TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)\nNow POV of you and me, similar Iraq\nI don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you\nThese beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you\nTake time and erase you, love don't hear no more\nNo I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more\n[Pre-Chorus - Taylor Swift:]\nOh, it's so sad to\nThink about the good times\nYou and I\n[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]\n'Cause baby, now we got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done\n'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!\nNow we got problems\nAnd I don't think we can solve 'em\nYou made a really deep cut\nAnd baby, now we got bad blood, hey!\n[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar:]\nHey! Remember when you tried to write me off?\nRemember when you thought I'd take a loss?\nDon't you remember? You thought that I would need yah\nFollow procedure, remember?
