{"lyrics": "I live down the street in a broken down house\nAnd a car up on blocks in the driveway\nThe moment we meet, there was never a doubt\nThat we won't forget this Sunday\nIt starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles\nAnd it all leads to this - our first kiss\nAll my friends are saying \nGirl, what are you thinking?\nYou're better off, \nyou're better off without him\nFind yourself another\nGirl, that boy is trouble\nYou're better off, you're better off\nThey can talk forever, they just don't know better\nWe drive around town in a rusty old truck\nSomehow it feels like we're flying\nDon't wanna come down\nBut they make it so tough\n'Cause everyone we know is trying\nTo push us apart hide it down in our hearts\nAnd they get what they want cause you're gone\nAll my friends are saying\nGirl, why are you crying?\nYou're better off, you're better off without him\nFind yourself another\nGirl, that boy is trouble\nYou're better off, you're better off\nThey can talk forever, they just don't know better\nYou come to my door\nIn the pouring rain\nWe know what we don't have to say\nYou hand me a rose and a note that says\nWe don't have to do things their way\nAll my friends are saying\nGirl, what are you thinking?\nYou're better off, you're better off without him\nFind yourself another\nGirl, that boy is trouble\nYou're better off, you're better off\nWell, they can talk forever, they just don't know better", "title": "Better Off", "album": null, "year": null}
