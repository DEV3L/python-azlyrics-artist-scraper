{"lyrics": "I shined your shoes\nI poured the wine\nI gave you all of my time\nI patched your dance smile\nThat your friends\nWhich apparently is a crime\nI gave you space\nYou took my place\nAnd gave it to her\nBut life's too long\nTo waste it all loving a liar\nAnd when love hands me matches now\nI'm gonna burn it down\nI keyed her car\nGot my guitar\nAnd wrote this damn song\nLook what you've found\nShe's been around\nI hear the lines long\nAnd don't you tell me\nTo be nice\nI'm not a nice girl\nShe died from complications\nOf the things you told her\nSo when love hands me matches now\nI'm gonna burn it down\nAin't it funny\nYou said honey\nYou meant sitting duck\nWell i say cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver\nJust a few I've thought of\nAnd when love hands me matches now\n'Gonna burn it down\nI'm gonna burn it down\nOh yeah\nGonna burn it, burn it, burn it down\nMatches, now", "title": "Matches", "album": null, "year": null}
