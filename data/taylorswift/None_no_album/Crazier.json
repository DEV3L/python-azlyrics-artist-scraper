{"lyrics": "\"Crazier\"\nI'd never gone with the wind\nJust let it flow\nLet it take me where it wants to go\n'Til you open the door\nThere's so much more\nI'd never seen it before\nI was trying to fly\nBut I couldn't find wings\nBut you came along and you changed everything\n[Chorus:]\nYou lift my feet off the ground\nYou spin me around\nYou make me crazier, crazier\nFeels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes\nYou make me crazier, crazier, crazier\nI've watched from a distance as you made life your own\nEvery sky was your own kind of blue\nAnd I wanted to know how that would feel\nAnd you made it so real\nYou showed me something that I couldn't see\nYou opened my eyes\nAnd you made me believe\n[Chorus]\nBaby you showed me what living is for\nI don't wanna hide anymore\nOh oh\nYou lift my feet off the ground\nYou spin me around\nYou make me crazier, crazier\nFeels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes\nYou make me crazier, crazier, crazier\nCrazier, crazier.", "title": "Crazier", "year": null, "album": null}
