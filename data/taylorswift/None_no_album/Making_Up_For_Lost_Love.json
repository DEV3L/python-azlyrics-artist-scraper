{"lyrics": "I need you more than I know how to mention\nAnd I'd give forever to get your attention\nBe you're summer midnight with starry blue eyes\nThat only see you and are yours every night\nOoh, ooh, love's like this\nIt's something I missed\nOoh, ooh, love's like this\nAnd that small town daydream\nLasted all night\nCussing out all those bright city lights\nJust look at you look at me\nHeaven looked down to see\nWe're falling now\nAnd there's nothing we ain't too sure of\nJust two kids making up for lost love\nAll of the days that I couldn't get it right\nIt all disappeared lying here by your side\nWith your dirty blue jeans and my crooked smile\nYou make it look easy changing my life\nOoh, ooh, love's like this\nIt's something I missed\nOoh, ooh, love's like this\nSmall town daydream\nLasted all night\nCussing out all those bright city lights\nJust look at you look at me\nHeaven looked down to see\nWe're falling now\nAnd there's nothing we ain't too sure of\nJust two kids making up for lost love\nHeaven had quite the time\nTo figure this life out\nBut baby I've got mine\nTo give you everything you dream about\nOoh, ooh, love's like this\nAnd it's something I don't miss anymore\nOoh, ooh, love's like this\nAnd that small town daydream\nLasted all night\nCussing out all those bright city lights\nJust look at you look at me\nHeaven looked down to see\nWe're falling now\nSmall town daydream\nLasted all night\nCussing out all those bright city lights\nJust look at you look at me\nHeaven looked down to see\nWe're falling now\nAnd there's nothing we ain't too sure of\nJust two kids making up for lost love\nJust two kids making up for lost love", "title": "Making Up For Lost Love", "album": null, "year": null}
