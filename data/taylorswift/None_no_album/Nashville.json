{"lyrics": "(originally by David Mead)\nOn a crowded highway\nThrough a night alone\nI was barely breathing\nI was crawling home\nWell, it's quite not London\nOr the south of France\nOr an Asian Island\nOr a second chance\nGoing back to Nashville\nThinking 'bout the whole thing\nGuess you gotta run sometimes\nMaybe I'm a fast train\nBlowin' through a valley\nWatching all my life go by\nYou're a distant memory\nYou're an exit sign\nI was talking crazy\nOn the drivers side\nAnd I know I hurt you\nBut I can't confess\nWas that blood or a wine stain\nOn your wedding dress\nGoing back to Nashville\nThinking 'bout the whole thing\nGuess you gotta run sometimes\nMaybe I'm a fast train\nBlowing through a mountain\nWatching all my life go by\nGoing back to Nashville\nLaughing at a bad break\nWhat's the use of wondering why?\nMaybe I'm a storm front\nBlowing through a valley\nTearing up a good July\nAnd its safe and warm\nWhere nothing ever happens\nCould it be so hard\nTo realign a star or two\nChange a southern night for you\nGoing back to Nashville\nThinking bout the whole thing\nGuess you gotta run sometimes\nMaybe I'm a fast train\nBlowing though a valley\nTearing up a good July\nI'm going back to Nashville\nLaughing at a bad break\nWhat's the use of wondering why?\nMaybe I'm a storm front\nBlowing through the valley\nTearing up a good July\nGoing back to Nashville\nI'm going back to Nashville\nGoing back to Naaaaahh....\nGoing back to Nashville\nWhat's the use of wondering why?", "title": "Nashville", "album": null, "year": null}
