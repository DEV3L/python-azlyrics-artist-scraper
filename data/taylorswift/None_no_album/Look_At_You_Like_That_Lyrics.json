  "lyrics": "There you are\nStanding there looking like you don't know what to say\nBut I know that face\nAnd here I am\nBracing myself for what I know is coming my way\nWhat a waste\nFor all of that time, I thought you were mine\nWas I just kidding myself?\nLetting it go and loving you so\nDon't you dare tell me not to look at you like that\nI'm gonna look at you like that\nI'm gonna hang my head and turn my back\nTo your sneak attack\nIf it's the last thing that I do\nI'm gonna make this hard on you\nWhile I look at you like that\nDon't you say\nThat we can still be friends, it doesn't work that way\nThe end is the end\nAnd don't you dare think\nThat I'll pack up all my tears and take them home\nAnd cry them out when I'm alone\nI'll do it right here, I'm crying right now\nYou come and you can watch me crumble down\nThat's for breaking my heart, so, baby, don't start\nThinking you can ask me not to look at you like that\nI'm gonna look at you like that\nI'm gonna hang my head and turn my back\nTo your sneak attack\nIf it's the last thing that I do\nI'm gonna make this hard on you\nWhile I look at you like that\nDon't you tell me to be strong\nOr make it harder than it has to be\nAfter you are gone\nYou'll remember what you've done to me\n'Cause I'm gonna look at you like that\nGonna hang my head and turn my back\nTo your sneak attack\nIf it's the last thing that I do\nAfter what you put me through\nI'm gonna have to let you know\nHow much it hurts to let you go\nOh yeah\nGonna look at you like that\nLook at you, look at you, look at you\nLike that",
