{"lyrics": "\"What To Wear\"\nShe's looking in the mirror\nThe moment's getting nearer\nShe thinks about it as she walks her walk\nUp and down the staircase\nMake up fresh on her face\nShe thinks about it as she talks her talk\nSchool dance, first chance\nAlways been a dreamer\nThere's one guy, she's shy\nSees him through the mirror\nAnd everybody looks at her\nShe thinks about it\nBlue dress, angel face\nLooking in the mirror\nShoes, purse, hair tied back\nAnd you should see her\nShe's got her magic\nFloating through the air\nPeace, love\nOne thing leads into another\nDream big, aim small\nMan you gotta love her\nShe's got her hopes up\nGot 'em up to there\nWondering what to wear\nShe's standing in her bedroom\nHe'll be pulling up soon\nShe thinks about it when she sees headlights\nLooking out the window\nShe's got her diary to show\nThat she's been waiting for this all her life\nFirst date, can't wait\nLooking in the mirror\nHeart all wrapped up\nWait until he sees her\nHe's looking right at her\nShe thinks about it\nSixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt\nShoes, purse, hair tied back\nAnd you should see her\nShe's got her magic\nFloating through the air\nPeace, love\nOne thing leads into another\nDream big, aim small\nMan you gotta love her\nShe's got her hopes up\nGot 'em up to there\nWondering what to wear\nThe years went by\nThe mirror saw her cry\nShe got up again\nShe got up again\nThe wind blew by\nThe small town lights\nShe got up again\nMove out, find out\nWhere the world can take her\nBright lights, late nights\nLiving for the greater\nMove to Paris\nLiving on a prayer\nPeace, love\nOne thing leads into another\nDream big, aim small\nMan you gotta love her\nShe's got her hopes up\nGot 'em up to there\nShe's got her hopes up\nGot 'em up to there\nWondering what to wear\nOhh, oh, oh\nWondering what to wear", "title": "What To Wear", "year": null, "album": null}
