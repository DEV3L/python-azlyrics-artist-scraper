{"lyrics": "\"Sweet Escape\"\n(originally by Gwen Stefani)\nIf I could be sweet\nI would but first of all, let me say\nI must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way\nCause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor\nIts your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator\nMaybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold\nIf I could escape\nAnd recreate a place that's my own world\nAnd I could be your favorite girl\nForever, perfectly together\nNow tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet\nIf I could be sweet\nSorry, but I know I've been a real bad girl\nI didn't mean for you to get hurt\nWhatsoever\nWe can make it better\nNow tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet\nSweet escape, sweet escape\nYou let me drown\nI'm at my lowest boiling point\nCome help me out\nI need to get me out of this joint\nCome on, let's bounce\nCounting on you to turn me around\nInstead of clowning around\nLet's look for some common ground\nOh baby\nTimes been getting a little crazy\nI've been getting a little lazy\nWaiting for you to come save me\nI can see that you're angry\nBy the way that you treat me\nHopefully, you don't leave me\nWanna take you with me\nIf I could escape\nAnd recreate a place that's my own world\nAnd I could be your favorite girl\nForever, perfectly together\nNow tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet\nIf I could be sweet\nSorry, but I know I've been a real bad girl\nI didn't mean for you to get hurt\nWhatsoever\nWe can make it better\nNow tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet\nSweet escape, sweet escape", "title": "Sweet Escape", "year": null, "album": null}
