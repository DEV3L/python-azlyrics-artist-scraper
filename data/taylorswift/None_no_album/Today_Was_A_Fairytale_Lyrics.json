  "lyrics": "(from \"Valentine's Day\" soundtrack)\nToday was a fairytale\nYou were the prince\nI used to be a damsel in distress\nYou took me by the hand and you picked me up at six\nToday was a fairytale\nToday was a fairytale\nToday was a fairytale\nI wore a dress\nYou wore a dark grey T-shirt\nYou told me I was pretty\nWhen I looked like a mess\nToday was a fairytale\nTime slows down\nWhenever you're around\nBut can you feel this magic in the air?\nIt must have been the way you kissed me\nFell in love when I saw you standing there\nIt must have been the way\nToday was a fairytale\nIt must have been the way\nToday was a fairytale\nToday was a fairytale\nYou've got a smile that takes me to another planet\nEvery move you make everything you say is right\nToday was a fairytale\nToday was a fairytale\nAll that I can say\nIs now it's getting so much clearer\nNothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face\nToday was a fairytale\nTime slows down\nWhenever you're around\nBut can you feel this magic in the air?\nIt must have been the way you kissed me\nFell in love when I saw you standing there\nIt must have been the way\nToday was a fairytale\nIt must have been the way\nToday was a fairytale\nTime slows down\nWhenever you're around\nI can feel my heart\nIt's beating in my chest\nDid you feel it?\nI can't put this down\nBut can you feel this magic in the air?\nIt must have been the way you kissed me\nFell in love when I saw you standing there\nIt must have been the way\nBut can you feel this magic in the air?\nIt must have been the way you kissed me\nFell in love when I saw you standing there\nIt must have been the way\nToday was a fairytale\nIt must have been the way\nToday was a fairytale\nToday was a fairytale",
