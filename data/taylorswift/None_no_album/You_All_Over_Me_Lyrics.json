  "lyrics": "Once the last drop of rain, has dried off the pavement\nShouldn't [?] but I never do\nThe way the tires turn stones on old county roads\nYou leave it muddy underneath, reminds me of you\nYou find graffiti on the walls\nOf old bathroom stalls\nYou know, you can scratch it right off, it's how we used to be\nLike the dollar in your pocket, that's been spent and traded in\nYou can't change where it's been, reminds me of me\nI lived, and I learned, had you\nGot burned\nHeld out, held on\nGod knows, too long, you wasted my time\nLost tears, swore that I'd get out of here\nNo amount of freedom, gets you clean\nI still got you all over me\nGuess the worst day of June\nWas the one that I met you\nWith your hands in your pockets\nAnd your \"don't you wish you had me\" grin\nI did, so I smile, and I melted like a child\nNow every breath of air I breathe reminds me of back then\nWell I lived, and I learned, had you\nGot burned\nHeld out, held on\nGod knows, too long, you wasted my time\nLost tears, swore that I'd get out of here\nNo amount of freedom gets you clean\nI still got you all over me\nI lived, and I learned, and found out what it was to turn around\nAnd see that we were never really meant to be\nSo I lied, and I tried, and I watched a part of myself die\nNo amount of freedom, gets you clean\nI still got you all over me\nI still got you all over me\n...",
