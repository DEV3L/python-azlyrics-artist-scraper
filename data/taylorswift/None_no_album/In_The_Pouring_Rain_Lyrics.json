  "lyrics": "I loved you for a little, a little while\nI think you know that!\nIt would have worked for a little\nExcept for that day you...\nIt's not like you to be here\nWhen you said you won't!\nBut in the pouring rain\nYou changed everything\nYou changed the tune!\nIn the middle of the game\nYou changed everything\nYou changed the rules!\nIt's not like we could forget something quickly\nExcept in the pouring rain\nIt kills me to say this\nIt really does, it kills my heart!\nBut I might still love you\nReason we're just fallen apart\nBut it's not like me to answer\nGonna change my mind!\nBut in the pouring rain, you changed everything\nYou changed the tune!\nIn the middle of the game\nYou changed everything\nYou changed the rules!\nAnd it's not like we could forget something quickly\nExcept in the pouring rain\nOh, am I...\nAll I torn myself I would be losing!\nBut in the pouring rain, can you feel my pain?\nMy tears are falling down from the sky!\nIn the pouring rain, I can feel...\nI wonder who you love tonight\nOh, in the pouring rain\nIn the pouring rain\nOh, in the pouring rain!\nIn the pouring rain\nYou changed everything\nYou changed my mind",
