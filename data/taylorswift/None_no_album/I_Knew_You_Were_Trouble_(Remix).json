{"lyrics": "(feat. Sammy Adams)\n[Taylor Swift:]\nOnce upon a time a few mistakes ago\nI was in your sights, you got me alone\nYou found me, you found me, you found me\nI guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that\nAnd when I fell hard you took a step back\nWithout me, without me, without me\nAnd he's long gone when he's next to me\nAnd I realize the blame is on me\n'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in\nSo shame on me now\nFlew me to places I'd never been\n'Til you put me down, oh\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\nSo shame on me now\nFlew me to places I'd never been\nNow I'm lying on the cold hard ground\nOh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm)\nOh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble\nOh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] I told you I was, I was) trouble, trouble, trouble\nOh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble\n[Sammy Adams:]\nDouble platinum wherever she go\nSouth of France to Reno\nMet her out in Vegas\nWent in on casino \nRed lips so hard to miss\nWhat's wrong with being promiscuous\nAnd I can teach you bad, bad things\nIf you into it\nDon't need to get intimate...just yet\nSlow down, I know that \nYou thinking you and me...just met \nBut girl, I got the remedy most important in chemistry\nGood girl gone bad too much for a Kennedy\nSome say, some say, they sell they souls for a couple hits\nI'd rather live a life of gold with a perfect chick\nCause that one moment when your breathless and your hoping\nAnd ya feel the same way, same way \nSparks blowing off that cute face and that shy smile...oh man \nI haven't crushed this hard in quite a while...oh damn\nAnd I can care less that your famous\nWe can make the perfect couple\nCause my first name big, last name trouble\nYeah\n[Taylor Swift:]\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\nSo shame on me now\nFlew me to places I'd never been\n'Til you put me down, oh\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\nSo shame on me now\nFlew me to places I'd never been\nNow I'm lying on the cold hard ground\nOh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm)\nOh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble\nAnd the saddest fear comes creeping in\nThat you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\nSo shame on me now\nFlew me to places I'd never been\n'Til you put me down, oh\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)\nSo shame on me now\nFlew me to places I'd never been\nNow I'm lying on the cold hard ground\nOh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble\nOh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\nTrouble, trouble, trouble\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\nTrouble, trouble, trouble", "title": "I Knew You Were Trouble (Remix)", "album": null, "year": null}
