{"lyrics": "She didn't have a reason to go, oh no\nShe didn't have a reason to stay\nEither way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun\nShe looked at her keys and found a reason to run\nAnd time stands still when you're nowhere bound\nBut I understand it somehow\nIf I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?\nWould it be a million miles of cold white lies\nAnd unfamiliar exit signs?\nI just drive on by, just south of knowing why\nI didn't really know her that well\nBut I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind\nShe felt so out of touch, cos she just felt too much\nIf you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough\nAnd time stands still when you're nowhere bound\nThat's where I'm headed right now\nIf I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?\nWould it be a million miles of cold white lies\nAnd unfamiliar exit signs?\nI just drive on by, just south of knowing why\nI don't have a plan, I don't have a map\nI don't even know if I'm ever going back\nI don't have a when and I don't have a where\nI don't even know if I'll know when I'm there\nBut If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?\nWould it be a million miles of cold white lies\nAnd unfamiliar exit signs?\nI just drive on by\nI just drive on by, drive on, drive on\nDrive all night\nIf I drive on, drive on, drive on\nDrive all night, just south of knowing why", "title": "Just South Of Knowing Why", "album": null, "year": null}
