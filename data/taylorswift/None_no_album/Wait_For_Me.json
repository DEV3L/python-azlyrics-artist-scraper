{"lyrics": "If you had only gotten to me first\nIf I could write a book on how this hurts\nIf you could see the way your smile looks to me\nIf I wasn't scared of the world alone\nIf I didn't know he loves me so\nIf I could only find the strength to leave\nYou'd be with me, so baby\nDon't you look in my eyes\nI might fall in love\nWith a beautiful boy\nI wish that I could touch\nYou go I hope you think of me\nAs the stars fall down and the heavens fade\nThis girl is begging wait for me\nIt's so wrong that all I wanna do\nIs forget it all and just be with you\nI have to go 'cause he don't know\nBut the writing's on the wall\nBut here we are in so deep\nSoaking wet\nJumping in without no safety net\nAnd I don't know what kinda ropes\nWould break this kinda fall, so baby\nDon't you look in my eyes\nI might fall in love\nWith a beautiful boy\nI wish that I could touch\nYou go, I hope you think of me\nAs the stars fall down and the heavens fade\nThis girl is begging wait, wait for me\nWe can't be together right now\nGuess there's no use in trying\nBut if you look at me right now\nCan you tell that I'm dying\nTo hold you\nBut it would be wrong to\nSo don't you look in my eyes\nI might fall in love\nWith a beautiful boy\nI wish that I could touch\nYou go I hope you think of me\nAs the stars fall down and the heavens fade\nThis girl is begging wait for me\nDon't you look now\nDon't you look now\nI might fall in love\nDon't you look now", "title": "Wait For Me", "album": null, "year": null}
