{"lyrics": "\"The Diary Of Me\"\nI\u2019m a laid back\nT-shirt, blue jean, mood ring\nKinda girl\nHey yeah what\u2019s the word on you\nLay low I\u2019m a mission rebel\nAngel devil\nLittle left of the middle\nSometimes I get temperamental\nBut here I am an open book\nTurn the page it\u2019s all the rage\nGet a look on the inside\nOh what you get is what you see\nBaby you hold the key\nTo the diary of me\nI\u2019m poetry, complicated\nSimply stated\nHey yeah baby how about you\nI was born free\nI\u2019m a cell phone hippie\nAre you with me?\nWhen I mess up I don\u2019t get up\nI just get down yeah\nBut here I am an open book\nTurn the page it\u2019s all the rage\nGet a look on the inside\nOh what you get is what you see\nBaby you hold the key\nTo the diary of me\nIt\u2019s raining on Sunday\nThere\u2019s nothing on TV\nYesterday was lonely\nYou\u2019re the only one who gets me\nMy mind is like an island\nDrifting through the ocean\nI can\u2019t stop thinking about you\nI bet you\u2019re thinking of me too\nWell here I am an open book\nTurn the page it\u2019s all the rage\nGet a look on the inside\nOh what you get is what you see\nBaby you hold the key\nTo the diary of me\nYeah here I am an open book\nTurn the page it\u2019s all the rage\nGet a look on the inside\nOh what you get is what you see\nBaby you hold the key\nTo the diary of me", "title": "The Diary Of Me", "year": null, "album": null}
