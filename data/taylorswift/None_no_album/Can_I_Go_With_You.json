{"lyrics": "Any day now, they're talking war\nI can see the look that's in your eyes\nThey're not talking a week or two\nOh, daddy can I go with you?\nOh, daddy can I go with you?\nYou pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall\nI always knew this time would come\nWhen I ask how long you think you're gonna be\nYou say, this crazy world's come undone\nSummer's over and leaves begin to fall\nAnd another winter's on the way\nI knew I wasn't gonna take this very well\nBut I'd give anything to have you here today\nEveryday now they're talking war\n& I know this time is like it's never been before\nWe're not talking about a week or two\nOh, daddy can I go with you?\nOh, daddy can I go with you?\nOh, daddy can I go with you?", "title": "Can I Go With You", "album": null, "year": null}
