  "lyrics": "There's a little girl in this little town\nWith a little too much heart to go around.\n\"Live forever. Never say never.\nYou can do better,\" that's what she says.\nHer mama named her Lucky on a starlit night.\nA rabbit foot in her pocket. She dances in spite\nOf the fact that she's different,\nAnd yet she's the same.\nAnd she says, \"Do do do...\"\nLucky you, lucky you\nShe sings her little song. She walks along\nA little pathway headed for the skies.\nLeft to travels, lives they unravel.\n\"Mind over matter,\" that's what she says.\nHer mama named her Lucky on a starlit night.\nA rabbit foot in her pocket. She dances in spite\nOf the fact that she's different,\nAnd yet she's the same.\nAnd she says, \"Do do do...\"\nLucky you, lucky you, lucky you.\nMaybe she'll sing you \"Do do do do.\"\nMaybe she'll bring you up to the skies.\nHoney, she'll love you. Funny how some view\nAngels above you ain't so far away.\nHer mama named her Lucky on a starlit night.\nA rabbit foot in her pocket. She dances in spite\nOf the fact that she's different,\nAnd yet she's the same.\nAnd she says, \"Do do do...\"\nLucky you, lucky you.",
