  "lyrics": "I heard a song tonight on the radio\nAnother girl sings about a boy\nShe sees his face\nIn every space\nEvery room\nAnd I know if I turn around you won't be there\nIf I close my eyes will you be there?\nI don't wanna lose your face\nAnd I don't wanna wake up one day\nAnd not remember what time erased\nAnd I don't wanna turn around\n'Cause I'm not scared\nOf what love gave me and took away\nAnd I don't wanna lose your face\nI've got a picture of you in my bedroom\nAnd I hope it never falls\nI hope I never lose that feeling\nI used to get when you would call\nAnd now I wonder to myself\nWho were you? Where are you?\nWere you ever here at all?\nI don't wanna lose your face\nAnd I don't wanna wake up one day\nAnd not remember what time erased\nAnd I don't wanna turn around\n'Cause I'm not scared\nOf what love gave me and took away\nAnd I don't wanna lose your face\nThat girl in the song had it so good\nI wish I could close my eyes and see you\nI wish the sky had your face\nAnd the oceans had your eyes\nAnd the sunset had your lips\nAnd I had you\nI don't wanna lose your face\nI don't wanna wake up one day\nAnd not remember what time erased\nAnd I don't wanna turn around\n'Cause I'm not scared\nOf what love gave me and took away\nAnd I don't wanna lose your face\nI don't wanna lose your face\nI don't wanna turn around",
