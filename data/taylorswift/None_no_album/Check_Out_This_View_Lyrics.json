  "lyrics": "I don't need a lot, but there's one thing love has taught me\nIt's to never expect too much\nDon't need a believable touch\nI just need you\nI just need you\nDon't need mine, I found mine\nWhy should we be wasting time?\nYou don't know what you missed\nI looked into your eyes like this\nAnd you should be in front of me\nSeeing everything I see looking at you\nCheck out this view\nThink of a quiet beach\nThink of how the waves crash down\nThink about a summer's eve\nNo offense to them but they ain't got nothing\nYou walk in a room\nIn the light or in the dark\nWell, nothing shadows who you are\nAnd you don't know what you missed\nI look into your eyes like this\nYou should be in front of me\nSeeing everything I see looking at you\nCheck out this view\nI look outside the window\nEveryday, see something new\nBut all I ever wanted was a window looking at you\nAt you\nYou don't know what you missed\nI look into your eyes like this\nYou should be in front of me\nSeeing everything I see looking at you\nCheck out this view",
