  "lyrics": "What a thing to see\nWhat a thing to be\nWhat a perfect love, what a perfect home\n'Cause every time she walks\nAnd every time she talks\nIs every time he knows what a perfect world he's living on\nBut whenever he's gone and when she's all alone\nHis heart goes out to her on the telephone\nAnd he says, \"Sugar, how I love you\nHow I think about you all the time\"\nHe calls her \"Sugar\" 'cause she's the sweetest thing\nOh, she's the best thing he'll ever find\nWith her midnight hair\nAnd with his favorite stare\nShe's a southern belle, he's a rockout king\nWhen she looks around\nOh, she knows she's found\nSuch a perfect life, such a perfect thing\nAnd whenever he's gone and when she's all alone\nHis heart goes out to her on the telephone\nAnd he says, \"Sugar, how I love you\nHow I think about you all the time\"\nHe calls her \"Sugar\" 'cause she's the sweetest thing\nOh, she's the best thing he'll ever find\nOh, there's a reason for every season\nThere's a change within the range of every heart\nBut the reason and the season\nSeem to be right so far\nAnd he says, \"Sugar, how I love you\nHow I think about you all the time\"\nHe calls her \"Sugar\" 'cause she's the sweetest thing\nOh, she's the best thing he'll ever find\nHe calls her \"Sugar\"",
