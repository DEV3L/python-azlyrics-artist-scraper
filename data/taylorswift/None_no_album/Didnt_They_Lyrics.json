  "lyrics": "She walks to school with her arms crossed\nIt's just another day\nAt 10 o'clock she hears this screaming\nThen finally she sees them\nIt's scary how things change\nAnd I saw the story on the news\nI saw the footage from the roof\nI sat down and cried\nDidn't she call you?\nDidn't she need you bad enough?\nWas there some reason I'm not aware of?\nDid you not write it down\nJust one more thing to do\nWhere were you\nAnd didn't she pray too\nHe kissed his wife good bye\nAnd took the earliest flight\nSo he could be home that night\nTo put his kids to sleep\nDown the aisle three men walked and said,\n\"We're here to die for our God.\"\nHe stood up and said, \"That's funny,\n'Cause my God died for me.\"\nI put the magazine down\nI read his words out loud\nI sat down and cried\nDidn't he call you?\nDidn't he need you bad enough?\nWas there some reason I'm not aware of?\nDid you not write it down?\nJust one more thing to do\nWhere were you?\nAnd didn't he pray too?\nThe taxis pulled up on the very day of\nThey rode 100 floors up just to come back down\nThey never thought they'd see the day\nThat the towers up in flames\nThere was nothing left to say when it all came down\nAnd didn't they call you?\nDidn't they need you bad enough?\nWas there some reason I'm not aware of?\nDid you not write it down?\nJust one more thing to do\nWhere were you? Where were you?\nAnd didn't they pray too?\nI walk to school and I wear a cross\nI'm counting every day",
