  "lyrics": "Your beautiful eyes\nStare right into my eyes\nAnd sometimes I think of you late at night\nI don't know why\nI want to be somewhere where you are\nI want to be where...\n[Chorus:]\nYou're here, your eyes are looking into mine\nSo baby, make me fly\nMy heart has never felt this way before\nI'm looking through your\nI'm looking through your eyes\nI wake up, I'm alive\nIn only a little while... I'll cry\nCause you're my lullaby\nSo baby come hold me tight cause I-I\nI want to be everything you need\nI want to be where...\n[Chorus]\nJust as long as you're mine\nI'll be your everything tonight\nLet me love you, kiss you\nOh baby let me miss you\nLet me see your\nDream about\nDream about\nDream about your eyes\nEyes, eyes... beautiful eyes",
