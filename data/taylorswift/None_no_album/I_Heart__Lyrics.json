  "lyrics": "Wish I had concentrated\nThey said love was complicated\nBut it's something I just fell into\nAnd it was overrated\nBut just look what I created\nI keep my life in black and blue\nBefore you ask me if I'm alright\nThink about what I had to do, ooh yeah\nWake up and smell the breakup\nFix my heart, put on my make-up\nAnother mess I didn't plan\nAnd I'll bet you thought you beat me\nWish you could only see\nI got an I heart question mark\nWritten on the back of my hand\nI'll be fine if you just walk by\nBut you had to talk about why\nYou were wrong and I was right\nBut I can't believe you made me\nSit at home, cry like a baby\nWait right by the phone every night\nAnd now you ask about you and I\nThere's no you and I\nRemember what you put me through\nI had to wake up and smell the breakup\nFix my heart, put on my make-up\nAnother mess I didn't plan\nAnd I'll bet you thought you beat me\nWish you could only see\nI got an I heart question mark\nWritten on the back of my hand\nAnd when you're home all alone at night\nYou'll still wonder why\nYou took everything I had, oh baby\nI haven't thought about you and I\nThere's no you and I\nAnd I know someday you will\nWake up and smell the breakup\nRealize that we won't make-up\nIt didn't go the way you planned\nAnd you'll know you didn't beat me\nWhen you look down and see\nI got an I heart question mark written on the back of my hand\nWritten on the back of my hand\nAn I heart question mark, yeah\nWritten on the back of my hand",
