{"lyrics": "Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh\nOnly sound, only sound that you hear is \"No\"\nYou never saw it coming\nSlipped when you started running\nAnd now you've come undone and I, I, I, I\nSeen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh\nSeen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade\nWish I could make it better\nSomeday you won't remember\nThis pain you thought would last forever and ever\nThere you'll stand, ten feet tall\nI will say, \"I knew it all along.\"\nYour eyes\u2013wider than distance\nThis life\u2013sweeter than fiction\nJust a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh\nAll you got, all you got are your shattered hopes\nThey never saw it coming\nYou hit the ground running\nAnd now you're onto something, I, I, I say\nWhat a sight, what a sight when the light came on\nProved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong\nAnd in this perfect weather\nIt's like we don't remember\nThe rain we thought would last forever and ever\nThere you'll stand, ten feet tall\nI will say, \"I knew it all along.\"\nYour eyes\u2013wider than distance\nThis life\u2013sweeter than fiction\nThere you'll stand, next to me\nAll at once, the rest is history\nYour eyes\u2013wider than distance\nThis life\u2013sweeter than fiction, fiction\nI'll be one of the many saying,\n\"Look at you now, look at you now, now.\"\nI'll be one of the many saying,\n\"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud.\"\nI'll be one of the many saying,\n\"Look at you now, look at you now, now.\"\nI'll be one of the many saying,\n\"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud.\"\nAnd when they call your name\nand they put your picture in a frame\nYou know that I'll be there time and again\n'Cause I loved you when, when you\nHit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh\nOnly sound, only sound that you heard was \"No\"\nNow in this perfect weather\nIt's like we don't remember\nThe rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)\nThere you'll stand, ten feet tall\nI will say, \"I knew it all along.\"\nYour eyes\u2013wider than distance\nThis life\u2013sweeter than fiction\nThere you'll stand next to me\nAll at once, the rest is history\nYour eyes\u2013wider than distance\nThis life\u2013sweeter than fiction, fiction\nIt's sweeter than fiction\nIt's sweeter, yeah\nIt's sweeter than, sweeter\nSweeter than fiction", "title": "Sweeter Than Fiction", "album": null, "year": null}
