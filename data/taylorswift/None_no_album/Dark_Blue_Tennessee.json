{"lyrics": "\"Dark Blue Tennessee\"\nHe said, \"I got me a nice new apartment\nIn a city, wouldn't you have hated that?\nI'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with.\"\nHe hangs up the phone and she whispers back,\nMissing you like this is such sweet sorrow\nWon't you come back to me?\nI'll be here, today and here tomorrow\nIn dark blue Tennessee\nHe was lying when he said he moved to L.A.\nHe's just hiding out on the other side of town\nWith his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away\nHe's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,\nMissing you like this is such sweet sorrow\nWon't you come back to me?\nI'll be here, today and here tomorrow\nIn dark blue Tennessee\nShe almost called him on the night that he wrote\nThese simple words on his goodbye note\nMissing you like this is such sweet sorrow\nWon't you come back to me?\nI'll be here, today and here tomorrow\nIn dark blue Tennessee\nIn dark blue Tennessee", "title": "Dark Blue Tennessee", "year": null, "album": null}
