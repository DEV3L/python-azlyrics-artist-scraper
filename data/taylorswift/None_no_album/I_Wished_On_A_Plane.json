{"lyrics": "\"I Wished On A Plane\"\nThrowing pennies at the fountain, \nWhen you're standing on a mountain, \nIt's kinda hard to aim. \nBut like the trees we cut our names in, \nThere must be an explanation, \nGuess it didn't given off rain. \nI need reasons why you're leaving \n[Chorus:]\nWell I guess I wished on a plane, \nI thought was a star, \nI guess what you wrote on a paper \nWasn't really from your heart \nCould've sworn you said you loved me \nI guess heard you wrong \nAnd I guess I wished on a plane \nAnd I thought was a star. \nDiving off into the deep end, \nHonestly believe you'd be there, \nWhen I jumped in, \nIs ain't your territory, \nWe had the perfect love story, \nexcept ending. \nNothing comes true, \nWhen it comes to you. \n[Chorus:]\nWell I guess I wished on a plane,\nI thought was a star, \nI guess what you wrote on a paper \nWasn't really from your heart \nCould've sworn you said you loved me \nI guess heard you wrong \nAnd I guess I wished on a plane \nAnd I thought it was a star. \nAnd I was too cloudy, \nIt's not my fault I just couldn't see. \n[Chorus:]\nWell I guess I wished on a plane, \nI thought it was a star, \nI guess what you wrote on a paper \nWasn't really in your heart\nCould've sworn you said you loved me \nI guess heard you wrong \nAnd I guess I wished on a plane \nAnd I thought it was a star. \nThrowing pennies at the fountain, \nWhen you're standing on a mountain, \nIt's kinda hard to aim.", "title": "I Wished On A Plane", "year": null, "album": null}
