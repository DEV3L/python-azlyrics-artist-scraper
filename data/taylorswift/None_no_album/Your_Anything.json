{"lyrics": "I bet you lie awake at night\r\nTrying to make up your sweet mind\r\nWondering if you'll ever find\r\nJust what you want\r\nA home-town number one\r\nOr a California loaded gun\r\nBut you know you only get one\r\nOr that's what you thought\r\nBut here's what you've got\n[Chorus:]\r\nI could be your favorite blue jeans\r\nWith the holes in the knees\r\nIn the bottom of the top drawer\r\nI could be your little beauty queen\r\nJust a little outta reach\r\nOr the girl living next door\r\nI'll be your angel giving up her wings\r\nIf that's what you need\r\nI'd give everything to be your anything\nIf you want hard to get\r\nIf you want...\r\nAll you have to do is let me know\r\nIf you want a bumpy ride\r\nOr someone with a softer side\r\nEither one'll be alright\r\nJust let me know\r\nCause this is where it goes\n[Chorus]\nIt's not like I'm giving up who I am for you\r\nbut for someone like you it's just so easy to do\nI could be your favorite blue jeans\r\nWith the holes in the knees\r\nIn the bottom of the top drawer\r\nI could be your little beauty queen\r\nJust a little outta reach\r\nOr the girl living next door\r\nI'll be your angel giving up her wings\r\nIf that's what you need\nIf that's what you need\n[Chorus]", "title": "Your Anything", "album": null, "year": null}
