{"lyrics": "\"Lucky You\"\nThere's a little girl in this little town\nWith a little too much heart to go around\nLive forever, never say never\nYou could do better, that's what she says\nMama named her lucky on a starlit night\nA rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite\nOf the fact that she's different\nAnd yet she's the same\nAnd she says lucky you, lucky you\nShe sings her little song, she walks along\nA little pathway headed for the skies\nLeft to travels, lives they unravel\nMind over matter, that's what she says\nMama named her lucky on a starlit night\nA rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite\nOf the fact that she's different\nAnd yet she's the same\nAnd she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you\nMaybe she'll sing you do do do do\nMaybe she'll bring you into the skies\nHoney she'll love you, funny how some view\nAngels above you ain't so far away\nMama named her lucky on a starlit night\nA rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite\nOf the fact that she's different\nAnd yet she's the same\nAnd she says lucky you, lucky you", "title": "Lucky You", "year": null, "album": null}
