{"lyrics": "(originally by Vonda Shepard)\nI like the way you wanted me\nEvery night for so long, baby\nI like the way you needed me\nEvery time the things got rocky, yeah\nI was believing in you\nWas I mistaken?\nDo you mean,\nDo you mean what you say?\nWhen you say our love could last forever\nWell, I'd rather you be mean\nThan love and lie\nI'd rather hear the truth\nThan have to say goodbye\nI'd rather take a blow\nAt least then I would know\nBut baby don't you break my heart slow\nI like the way you'd hold me\nEvery night for so long, baby\nI like the way you'd sing to me\nEvery time the things got rocky, yeah\nI was believing in you\nWas I mistaken?\nDo you say,\nDo you say what you mean?\nWhen you say our love could last forever\nWell, I'd rather you be mean\nThan love and lie\nI'd rather hear the truth\nThan have to say goodbye\nI'd rather take a blow\nAt least then I would know\nBut baby don't you break my heart slow\nOh, yeah, yeah\nYou'd run around\nAnd lead me on forever\nWhile I stay at home\nStill thinking we're together\nI want our love to last forever\nBut I'd rather you be mean\nThan love and lie\nI'd rather hear the truth\nThan have to say goodbye\nAnd I'd rather take a blow\nAt least then I would know\nBut baby don't you break my heart slow\nNow baby don't you break my heart\nSlow", "title": "Baby, Don't You Break My Heart Slow", "album": null, "year": null}
