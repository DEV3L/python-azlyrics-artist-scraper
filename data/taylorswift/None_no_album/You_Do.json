{"lyrics": "\"You Do\"\nHere I am, once again\nIn your driveway, thinking I should be leaving\nI should go but it's so entertaining watching you breathing\nYou went and got to me like\nThe stupid song on the radio that you try to forget\nBut it sticks in your head\nSo goodbye, it's not goodnight\nCause I'll be seeing you in my dreamin'\nBoy, you got me like a shot to the heart\nGot me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car\nCaught a red light I ran right through\nGotta call my friends, tell them all about you\nAlways looking like a one of those nights\nWhen you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light\nYou got me, you do\nIn a daze, pull the shades\nClose my eyes and picture you at my window\nI relax; I go back to all the things you said\nThat only I know\nBoy, you got me like a shot to the heart\nGot me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car\nCaught a red light I ran right through\nGotta call my all my friends, tell them all about you\nAlways looking like a one of those nights\nWhen you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light\nYou got me, you do\nI run right out to my car\nAnd I pull out the drive\nIt's only been ten minutes\nBut I have to see you one more time\nCause you got me like a shot to the heart\nGot me shakin' so bad, I spilled my coffee in the car\nCaught a red light I ran right through\nGotta call my all my friends, tell them all about you\nAnd it's looking like a one of those nights\nWhen you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light\nYou got me, you do\nOh, you got me, you do", "title": "You Do", "year": null, "album": null}
