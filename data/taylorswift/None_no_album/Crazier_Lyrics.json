  "lyrics": "(from \"Hannah Montana: The Movie\" soundtrack)\nI'd never gone with the wind\nJust let it flow\nLet it take me where it wants to go\n'Til you open the door\nThere's so much more\nI'd never seen it before\nI was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings\nBut you came along and you changed everything\nYou lift my feet off the ground\nYou spin me around\nYou make me crazier, crazier\nFeels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes\nYou make me crazier, crazier, crazier\nI've watched from a distance\nAs you made life your own\nEvery sky was your own kind of blue\nAnd I wanted to know\nHow that would feel\nAnd you made it so real\nYou showed me something that I couldn't see\nYou opened my eyes and you made me believe\nYou lift my feet off the ground\nYou spin me around\nYou make me crazier, crazier\nFeels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes\nYou make me crazier, crazier, crazier\nBaby, you showed me what living is for\nI don't wanna hide anymore\nYou lift my feet off the ground\nYou spin me around\nYou make me crazier, crazier\nFeels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes\nYou make me crazier, crazier, crazier\nCrazier, crazier.",
