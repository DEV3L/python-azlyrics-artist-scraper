{"lyrics": "\"My Cure\"\nI know we've got a lot to say\nBetween now and forever\nBut I'd be a game if you would play\nAnd my dear you get better\nAll throughout the day\nYou smile and walk away\nAll I can think to do\nIs follow you\nIf you leave I'll be crawling back for more\nif you need love I'll be standing at your door\nI'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure\nwherever you think I am tonight \njust know we're miles from a heartbreak\nBecause in the blink of a pretty brown eye \nI'll be right where you are baby\nsometime along the way you take my breath away\ndistracted by he view\nI fall right into you\nand if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more\nand if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door\nI'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure\nthey say I need to see all the people out there waiting\nbut you take one look at me\nand I know the mistake I'd be making\ncuz if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more\nand if you ever need love I'm standing at your door\nI'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure\nI know we've got a lot to say between now and forever", "title": "My Cure", "year": null, "album": null}
