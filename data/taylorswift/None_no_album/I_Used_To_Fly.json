{"lyrics": "\"I Used To Fly\"\nI... I used to fly\nDidn't matter where I'd been\n'Cause I'd seen the sky\nI wanna tell you why\nBut somehow I know I\nWould break down and cry\nI know you can't see me here\nBut I am not alone\nI'm lying here in invisible arms\nAnd I won't be alone tonight\nYou... you know I would die\nBefore I let them see me\nSee me cry\nPlease don't leave tonight\nOh let me down slowly\nShow me a light\nI know you can't see me here\nBut I am not alone\nI'm lying here in invisible arms\nAnd I won't be alone tonight\nOh let me think I'm strong\nPlease don't bring me down\nI need you tonight\nI know you can't see me here\nBut I am not alone\nI'm lying here in invisible arms\nAnd I won't be alone tonight\nI... I used to fly\nDidn't matter where I'd been\n'Cause I'd seen the sky", "title": "I Used To Fly", "year": null, "album": null}
