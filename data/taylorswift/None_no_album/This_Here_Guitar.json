{"lyrics": "\"This Here Guitar\"\nWalking downtown shuffling my feet\nI try to dream my dreams above the concrete\nStore windows, traveled for miles\nBut something I passed really caught my eye\nIt was cracked down the middle, permanent scars\nBut I fell in love with this here guitar\nNice to meet you, can I teach you\nAll I know, can you show me what you do\nWhere have you been\nWhat have you seen\nWho were you before you even knew me\nHave you been played for endless hours\nOr were you left in the corner\nOr were you someone's best friend\nThis here guitar\nIt was my baby, anyone could see\nI love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty\nBut I can't help wondering why\nIt came to me and where we'll say goodbye\nThe cracks down the middle\nCan't see where they are\nSince I fell in love with this here guitar\nNice to meet you, can I teach you\nAll I know, can you show me what you do\nWhere have you been\nWhat have you seen\nWho were you before you even knew me\nHave you been played for endless hours\nOr were you left in the corner\nOr were you someone's best friend\nThis here guitar\nWere you a present from a father to a son\nDid he forget you \nOr just play you 'til you came undone\nHey did some prima donna love you \n'Til she got her fame and fortune\nI won't do that to you\nNice to meet you, I can teach you\nAll I know, you can show me what you do\nWhere have you been\nWhat have you seen\nWho were you before you even knew me\nAnd I played you for endless hours\nNever left you in the corner\nYou're my one and only friend\nNow I know where life lessons are\nThis here guitar\nYou're my guitar\nThis here guitar", "title": "This Here Guitar", "year": null, "album": null}
