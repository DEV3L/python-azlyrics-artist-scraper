  "lyrics": "He's got a nice little life\nHe's gonna live it, but on\nFriday nights he plays that mandolin\nPainted red, and he said\nIt's not the best I know\nBut it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine\nPeople there can't help but care\nAbout the friendly music of a guy\nWho's getting by from their applause\nHe's got a song that moves along\nHe's got his local crowd tonight\nAt Angelina's family bar and grill\nHe's got his heart on his sleeve\nThe songs he plays just living free\nBut who knows what goes through his mind\nWhen he plays a song it brings along\nEverybody saying\nWho's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin\nOh yeah, mandolin\nGot a car, got a scar\nLike everyone he's got a few but\nEverybody loves that mandolin\nGot his problems, bills to pay\nSomehow that boy finds a way\nThrough paychecks in tip jars, yeah\nHe's got his heart on his sleeve\nThe songs he plays just living free\nBut who knows what goes through his mind\nWhen he plays a song it brings along\nEverybody saying\nWho's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin\nOh yeah, mandolin\nOh he's the kind of guy\nWho never really wanted fame\nHis feet are planted firmly on the ground\nHe never wanted people to remember his name\nHe never wanted word to get around\nThat he found heaven on earth\nHe's got his heart on his sleeve\nThe songs he plays just living free\nBut who knows what goes through his mind\nWhen he plays a song it brings along\nEverybody saying\nWho's that guy who plays the mandolin\nOh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin\nMandolin\nOh, mandolin",
