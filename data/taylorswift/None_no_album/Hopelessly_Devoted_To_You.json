{"lyrics": "Guess mine is not the first heart broken\nMy eyes are not the first to cry\nI'm not the first to know\nThere's just no getting over you\nYou know I'm just a fool who's willing\nTo sit around and wait for you\nBut, baby, can't you see\nThere's nothing else for me to do?\nI'm hopelessly devoted to you\nBut now there's nowhere to hide\nSince you pushed my love aside\nI'm out of my head\nHopelessly devoted to you\nHopelessly devoted to you\nHopelessly devoted to you\nMy head is saying, \"Fool, forget him.\"\nMy heart is saying, \"Don't let go.\nHold on till the end.\"\nAnd that's what I intend to do\nI'm hopelessly devoted to you\nBut now there's nowhere to hide\nSince you pushed my love aside\nI'm out of my head\nHopelessly devoted to you\nHopelessly devoted to you\nHopelessly devoted to you", "title": "Hopelessly Devoted To You", "album": null, "year": null}
