{"lyrics": "\"Gracie\"\nMy name's Gracie\nI'll be five in May\nKinda scared 'cause\nI never been on a plane\nMy mama says that it'll be alright\n'Cause I'm gunna see my daddy tonight\nAnd she says that\nThere's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven\nAn' I don't wanna get there too soon\nAnd I know there's a God because I met him\nAnd I see it when I'm looking at you\nThere ain't no accidents in what we do\nMy name's Heather\nGuess we're on the same flight\nDon't mind Gracie\nShe could talk to you all night\nShe's finally well enough to travel\ndoctor says she's in the clear\nShe's been in and out of hospital\nSince the beginning of the year\nAnd there's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven\nBut none of us want to get there too soon\nAnd I know there's a God because I met him\nAnd I see it when I'm looking at you\nThere ain't no accidents in what we do\nJames T. Johnson\nThat's her daddy's name\nHe's been overseas\nIt'll be a year today\nHe never talked about being scared over the phone\nHe just said me and Gracie will come and take him on\nThere's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven\nAnd I don't wanna get there too soon\nAnd I know there's a God because I met him\nAnd I see it when I'm looking at you\nThere ain't no accidents in what we do\nAnd the people that we meet\nAs we go through the rain\nThere are no accidents in what we do", "title": "Gracie", "year": null, "album": null}
