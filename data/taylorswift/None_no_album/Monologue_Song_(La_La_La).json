{"lyrics": "I like glitter and sparkly dresses,\nBut I'm not gonna talk about that\nIn my monologue\nI like baking and things that smell like winter,\nBut I'm not gonna talk about that\nIn my monologue\nLa la la, la la la\nI like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me,\nBut I'm not gonna say that\nIn my monologue\nI like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public,\nBut I'm not gonna say that\nIn my monologue\nLa la, la la la la la\nThis is my musical monologue\nYou might think I'd bring up Joe,\nThe guy who broke up with me on the phone,\nBut I'm not gonna mention him\nIn my monologue\nHey Joe! I'm doing real well,\nTonight I'm hosting SNL\nBut I'm not gonna brag about that\nIn my monologue\nLa la la, ha ha ha\nHa ha ha, ha ha ha\nLa la la\nAnd if you're wondering if I might,\nBe dating the werewolf from Twilight,\n(Hi Taylor!)\nI'm not gonna comment on that\nIn my monologue\nLa la, la la la la la\nThis is my musical monologue\nYou might be expecting me to say\nSomething bad about Kanye\nAnd how he ran up on the stage\nAnd ruined my VMA monologue.....\nBut there's nothing more to say\nCause everything's okay\nI've got security lining this stage\nThis is my SNL monologue\nLa la, la la la la la\nThis is my SNL monologue\nLa la, la la la la la\nThat was my SNL monologue", "title": "Monologue Song (La La La)", "album": null, "year": null}
