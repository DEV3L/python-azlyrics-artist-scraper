  "lyrics": "Well, she was an American girl\nRaised on promises\nShe couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life\nSomewhere else\nAfter all it was a great big world\nWith lots of places to run to\nAnd if she had to die trying\nShe had one little promise she was gonna keep\nOh yeah, all right\nTake it easy baby\nMake it last all night\nShe was an American girl\nWell, it was kind of cold that night\nShe stood alone on her balcony\nShe could see the cars roll by\nOut on 441\nLike waves crashing on the beach\nAnd for one desperate moment there\nHe crept back in her memory\nGod, it's so painful\nIt's something that's so close but still so far out of reach\nOh yeah, all right\nTake it easy baby\nMake it last all night\nShe was an American girl\nOh yeah, all right\nTake it easy baby\nMake it last all night\nOh yeah, all right\nTake it easy baby\nOh, take it easy now\nOh yeah, all right\nShe was an American girl",
