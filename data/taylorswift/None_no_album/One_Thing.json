{"lyrics": "\"One Thing\"\nIt wasn't just like a movie\nThe rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin\nI'm driving away and I, I guess you could say\nThis is the last time I'll drive this way again\nWhen there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray\nCause I, I still love you but I can't\nBye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side\nBye, bye, baby\nI want you back but it's coming down to nothing\nAnd all you have is to walk away\nFrom the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah\nThe picture frame is empty\nIt's black and white, you're smiling down at me\nI take your photo off the dash\nAnd back to the conversation\nI was so sure of everything we thought we'd always have\nI'm lost in the sound of it\nBut here in the now comes in\nSeems like I'm becoming part of your past\nBye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side\nBye, bye, baby\nI want you back but it's coming down to nothing\nAnd all you have is to walk away\nFrom the one thing I thought would never leave me\nAnd there's so much that I can't touch\nYou're all I want but it's not enough this time\nAnd I can feel you like your slipping through my hands\nAnd I'm so scared of how this ends\nBye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side\nBye, bye, baby\nI want you back but it's coming down to nothing\nAnd all you have is to walk away\nFrom the one thing I thought would never leave me\nBye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side\nBye, bye, baby\nI want you back but it's coming down to nothing\nAnd all you have is to walk away\nFrom the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah, yeah\nThere was one thing I knew would never leave me\nIt wasn't just like a movie\nThe rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin", "title": "One Thing", "year": null, "album": null}
