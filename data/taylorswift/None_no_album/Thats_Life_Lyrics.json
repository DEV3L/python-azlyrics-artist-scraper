  "lyrics": "Like one of those fireflies\nOh, it looks so good till it's in your hand\nIt's like one of those memories\nWhere you can't let go, but you just can't stand\nIt's like one of those crazy dreams\nAnd the permanent screens in the magazines\nSaying, \"Why'd I love, all it does\nIs break your heart\"\nOne morning, does it all add up?\nOr am I just standing on the edge of crazy?\nYou're getting close to giving up\nIn a big old way, it knocks you down into the\nOther side every time\nLove or lie, live or die\nI, well, I guess that's life\nLike one of those people\nWith the beautiful eyes and the perfect face\nIt's like one of those stories\nWhere the hero dies in the very last race\nLike one of those endless cries\nAnd the crazy lies of a hurting child\nSaying, \"Why did love have to hurt?\nIt broke my heart\"\nOne morning, does it all add up?\nOr am I just standing on the edge of crazy?\nYou're getting close to giving up\nIn a big old way, it knocks you down into the\nDarker side every time\nLove or lie, live or die\nI, well, I guess that's life\nI always liked to think\nThat I was always brave enough\nTo try to master any push and shove\nWell, I guess I never qualified love\nOne morning, does it all add up?\nOr am I just standing on the edge of crazy?\nYou're getting close to giving up\nIn a big old way, it knocks you down into the\nOther side every time\nLove or lie, live or die\nI, well, I guess that's life\nOh, I guess that's life\nWell, I guess that's life",
