  "lyrics": "Time is passing slowly for the eight-year-old next door\nBut mama's watch is ticking off the wall\nJillian and Bobby think that they're a perfect pair\nThe girls could say he's just a bit too tall\nYou don't have to do to win big\nYou just have to think it\nSome folks say the glass is half full\nOthers choose to drink it\nSome say the grass could be greener\nAnd the other side ain't far away\nBut I say the old could be newer\nAnd love still counts when it doesn't stay\nSome say, \"I love you\"\nSome say love needs proof\nIt's all in your point of view\nHe hated pink, so she threw out her favorite clothes\nHis NFL was turned to TLC\nBaby's got an attitude and thinks they just don't know\nBut they all do and wish that she could see\nYou don't have to do to win big\nYou just have to think it\nSome folks say the glass is half full\nOthers choose to drink it\nSome say the grass could be greener\nAnd the other side ain't far away\nBut I say the old could be newer\nAnd love still counts when it doesn't stay\nSome say, \"I love you\"\nSome say love needs proof\nIt's all in your point of view\nIn the least, a masterpiece\nDepends on one's opinion\nWorst of all, they never call\nBut don't think that they weren't wishing\nSome say the grass could be greener\nAnd the other side ain't far away\nBut I say the old could be newer\nAnd love still counts when it doesn't stay\nSome say, \"I love you\"\nSome say love needs proof\nIt's all in your point of view\nIt's all in your point of view\nPoint of view\nIt's all in your point of view",
