{"lyrics": "I heard a song tonight on the radio\r\nAnother girl sings about a boy\r\nJust sees his face in every space in every room\r\nAnd i know that if i turn around you won't be there\r\nIf i close my eyes will you be there?\nI don't wanna lose your face\r\nAnd i don't wanna wake one day\r\nAnd not remember what time erased\r\nAnd i don't wanna turn around\r\nCoz i'm not scared\r\nOf what love gave me and took away\r\nAnd i don't wanna lose your face\nI've got a picture of you in my bedroom\r\nAnd i hope it never falls\r\nAnd i hope i never lose that feeling\r\nI used to get when you would call\r\nAnd now i wonder to myself\r\nWho were you and where are you?\r\nWere you ever here at all?\nI don't wanna lose your face\r\nAnd i don't wanna wake one day\r\nAnd not remember what time erased\r\nAnd i don't wanna turn around\r\nCoz i'm not scared\r\nOf what love gave me and took away\r\nAnd i don't wanna lose your face\nThat girl in the song had it so good\r\nI wish i could close my eyes and see you\r\nI wish the sky had your face\r\nAnd the oceans had your eyes\r\nAnd the sunset had your lips\r\nAnd i had you\nI don't wanna lose your face\r\nAnd i don't wanna wake one day\r\nAnd not remember what time erased\r\nAnd i don't wanna turn around\r\nCoz i'm not scared\r\nOf what love gave me and took away\r\nAnd i don't wanna lose your face", "title": "Your Face", "album": null, "year": null}
