  "lyrics": "(originally by Earth, Wind & Fire)\nDo you remember\nThe 28th night of September?\nLove was changin' the minds of pretenders\nOr chasin' the clouds away\nOur hearts were ringin'\nIn the key bed, our souls were singin'\nAs we danced in the night, remember\nHow the stars stole the night away\nI-I see that you remember\nAi, ai, dancin' in September\nAi, ai, never was a cloudy day\nMy thoughts are with you\nHolding hands with your heart to see you\nDon't need blue talk in love, remember\nHow we knew that was here to stay\nNow, December\nFound the love that we shared in September\nOnly blue talk in love, remember\nThe love that we share today\nI-I see that you remember\nAi, ai, dancin' in September\nAi, ai, never was a cloudy day\nI-I see that you remember\nAi, ai, dancin' in September\nAi, ai, golden dreams were shiny days\nDo you remember\nThe 28th night of September?\nI-I see that you remember\nAi, ai, dancin' in September\nAi, ai, never was a cloudy day\nI-I see that you remember\nAi, ai, dancin' in September\nAi, ai, golden dreams were shiny days\nAnd there never was a cloudy day\nThere never was a cloudy day",
