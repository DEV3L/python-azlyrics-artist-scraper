  "lyrics": "I don't think that passenger seat\nHas ever looked this good to me\nHe tells me about his nights\nAnd I count the colors in his eyes\nHe'll never fall in love he swears\nAs he runs his fingers through his hair\nI'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong\nAnd I don't think it ever crossed his mind\nHe tells a joke, I fake a smile\nBut I know all his favorite songs\nAnd I could tell you his favorite color's green\nHe loves to argue, born on the seventeenth\nHis sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes\nAnd if you asked me if I love him,\nI'd lie\nHe looks around the room\nInnocently overlooks the truth\nShouldn't a light go on?\nDoesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?\nHe sees everything black and white\nNever let nobody see him cry\nI don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine\nI could tell you his favorite color's green\nHe loves to argue, born on the seventeenth\nHis sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes\nAnd if you asked me if I love him,\nI'd lie\nHe stands there, then walks away\nMy God, if I could only say,\n\"I'm holding every breath for you.\"\nHe'd never tell you, but he can play guitar\nI think he can see through everything but my heart\nFirst thought when I wake up\nIs \"My God, he's beautiful.\"\nSo I put on my make-up\nAnd pray for a miracle\nYes, I could tell you his favorite color's green\nHe loves to argue, oh, and it kills me\nHis sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes\nAnd if you asked me if I love him\nIf you asked me if I love him\nI'd lie",
