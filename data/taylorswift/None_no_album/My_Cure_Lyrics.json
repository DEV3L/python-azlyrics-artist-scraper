  "lyrics": "I know we've got a lot to say\nBetween now and forever\nBut I'd be a game if you would play\nAnd not dare this to get better\nSo all throughout the day\nYou smile and walk away\nAll I can think to do\nIs follow you\nIf you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more\nIf you ever need love I'm standing at your door\nI'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure\nWherever you think I am tonight\nJust know we're miles from a heartbreak\nBecause in the blink of one pretty brown eye\nI'll be right where you are baby\nSometime along the way\nYou took my breath away\nDistracted by the view\nI fall right into you\nIf you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more\nAnd if you ever need love I'm standing at your door\nI'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure\nThey say I need to see all the people out there waiting\nBut you take one look at me\nAnd I know the mistake I'd be making\n'Cause if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more\nAnd if you ever need my love I'm standing at your door\nI'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure\nI know we've got a lot to say between now and forever",
