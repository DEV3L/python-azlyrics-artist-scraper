{"lyrics": "I got a lying smile I never put out for you\nCause I guess I never felt like I really needed to\nAnd they say little girls have big dreams\nAnd nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you\nAnd it was a long time coming\nI waited half my life just to find someone like you\nI spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out\nNot knowing it'd be a long time going\nThey say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all\nAnd I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall\nAnd they say little girls are so naive\nThat wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you\nAnd it was a long time coming\nI waited half my life just to find someone like you\nI spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out\nNot knowing it will be a long time going\nI've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights\nWashed my sins on the neon lights\nAnd I'm still not over you\nAnd it was a long time coming\nI waited half my life just to find someone like you\nI spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out\nNot knowing it will be a long time going\nA long time going\nAnd it will be a long time, long time going\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh\nIt will be a long time, long time going, going\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh", "title": "Long Time Coming", "album": null, "year": null}
