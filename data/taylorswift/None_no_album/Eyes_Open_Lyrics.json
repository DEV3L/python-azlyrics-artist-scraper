  "lyrics": "(from \"The Hunger Games\" soundtrack)\nEverybody's waiting\nEverybody's watching\nEven when you're sleeping\nKeep your ey-eyes open\nThe tricky thing\nIs yesterday we were just children\nPlaying soldiers\nJust pretending\nDreaming dreams with happy endings\nIn backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords\nBut now we've stepped into a cruel world\nWhere everybody stands and keeps score\nKeep your eyes open\nEverybody's waiting for you to break down\nEverybody's watching to see the fallout\nEven when you're sleeping, sleeping\nKeep your ey-eyes open\nKeep your ey-eyes open\nKeep your ey-eyes open\nSo here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard\nEvery lesson forms a new scar\nThey never thought you'd make it this far\nBut turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you\nIt's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now\nBut you've got something they don't\nYeah you've got something they don't\nYou've just gotta keep your eyes open\nEverybody's waiting for you to break down\nEverybody's watching to see the fallout\nEven when you're sleeping, sleeping\nKeep your ey-eyes open\nKeep your ey-eyes open\nKeep your ey-eyes\nKeep your feet ready\nHeartbeat steady\nKeep your eyes open\nKeep your aim locked\nThe night goes dark\nKeep your eyes open\n(Keep your eyes open [4x])\nEverybody's waiting for you to break down\nEverybody's watching to see the fallout\nEven when you're sleeping, sleeping\nKeep your ey-eyes open\nKeep your ey-eyes open\nKeep your ey-eyes open\nKeep your ey-eyes open\nKeep your ey-eyes open",
