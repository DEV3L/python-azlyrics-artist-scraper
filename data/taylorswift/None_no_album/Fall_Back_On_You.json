{"lyrics": "\"Fall Back On You\"\nIsn't it funny how many times we can say,\nWe drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page,\nAnd moved on\nThat's what we thought\nBut here I am in the same old car,\nHaving myself another same old brown-eyed bar\nUh oh, uh oh,\nI won't tell nobody\nI won't tell my friends\nWe'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends\nAnd we'll tell each other things like I need you\nYou and me\nBaby this is what we do\nI may see\nThere are people you just come back to\nSo fall back on me\nFall back on you\nYou always let someone come in between\nYour talking round the truth and never say what we mean\nLook at all this wasted time\nI won't tell nobody\nI won't tell my friend\nWe'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end\nAnd we'll tell each other things, like I love you\nYou and me\nBaby this is what we do\nI may see\nThere are people who you come back to\nSo fall back on me,\nFall back on you\nMaybe we'll last\nMaybe we won't\nMaybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost\nBut just, baby, get along with me\nYou and me\nBaby this is what we do\nI may see\nThere are people that you come back too\nFall back on me\nBaby I'll fall back on you\nFall back on me baby,\nBaby I'll fall back on you\nFall back on you\nFall back on you", "title": "Fall Back On You", "year": null, "album": null}
