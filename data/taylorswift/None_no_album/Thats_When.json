{"lyrics": "\"That's When\"\nI said I know\nHe said need some time, need some space\nTo think about all of this\nI watched him go\nHe watched me crushed to the floor\nOn my knees, just like that\nHe said, \"When can I come back?\"\nI said, that's when I wake up in the morning\nThat's when after sun is always storming\nLaughing when I'm crying\nThat's when I'll be waiting at the front gate\nThat's when never see your face\nI let you in, baby that's when\nI said I know,\nHe said I did you wrong, made mistakes\nPut you through all of this\n'Cause I let you go, you let me think\nThat I'll be fine without you\nImagine that!\nSo baby I'll come back\nI said, that's when I wake up in the morning\nThat's when after sun is always storming\nLaughing when I'm crying\nThat's when I'll be waiting at the front gate\nThat's when I'll never see your face\nI let you in, baby that's when\nAnd I said all this playing\nDid you ever think of me?\nAnd he said\nThat's when I woke up in the morning\nThat's when after sun is always storming\nLaughing when I was crying!\nAnd that's when we will waiting up to f*ckin'\nThat's when I saw your face\nTo let me in, baby that's when\nI said I know\nHe said I need some time, need some space", "title": "That's When", "year": null, "album": null}
