{"lyrics": "Sometimes I wonder how it's gonna feel\nWill my first love be true and real?\nWill I be ready when my heart starts to fall?\nWhat will I do when my love comes to call?\nAnd my daddy tells me that I light up his world\nEveryday he says, darling you're my best girl\nHe tried to teach me from the very start\nThe meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart\nWill my love come in a bowl of fire?\nWill it be filled with hope and desire?\nWill my love come in a pouring rain?\nAm I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain\nAm I ready for the boy, am I ready for love\nI know I'm not a little girl anymore\nCause I'm feeling things I've never felt before\nSweet sensations and anticipations\nCalling commotion to my emotions\nAnd I hear the words my daddy said to me\nHe said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free\nAnd love will find you one way or another\nBe good to yourself and be good to each other\nWill my love come in a bowl of fire?\nWill it be filled with hope and desire?\nWill my love come in a pouring rain?\nAm I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain\nAm I ready for the boy, am I ready for love\nIt's a run around the world\nAnd it's moving so fast\nThough I wanna find\nA love that's gonna last\nA love so strong\nThat I can withstand\nThe weight of the world\nIn the palm of its hand\nWill my love come in a bowl of fire?\nWill it be filled with hope and desire?\nWill my love come in a pouring rain?\nAm I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain\nAm I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game\nAm I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars\nAm I ready for the bliss, am I ready for love", "title": "Am I Ready For Love", "album": null, "year": null}
