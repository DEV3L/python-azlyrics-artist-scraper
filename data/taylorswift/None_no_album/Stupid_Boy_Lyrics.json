  "lyrics": "Let me know, how's it feel\nTo be under my skin, wrapped around my heart\nIs it like anywhere you've been?\nAnd everything I do, I do it just for you\nSo why the hell don't you love me?\nWhy the hell don't you need me like I need you?\nAre you so far above me?\nDon't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?\nBut I was just a toy, which you destroyed\nStupid boy\nI have been looking in, trying to read your mind\nGive you the benefit of the doubt, every single time\nAnd then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside\nWhy the hell don't you love me?\nWhy the hell don't you need me like I need you?\nAre you so far above me?\nDon't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?\nBut I was just a toy, which you destroyed\nStupid boy\nWhat happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?\nYou take one look at me, 'cause that's what it cost.\nI was gonna be everything you need\n'Cause you're everything to me\nSo why the hell don't you love me?\nWhy the hell don't you need me like I need you?\nAre you so far above me?\nDon't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?\nBut I was just a toy, which you destroyed\nStupid boy\nLet me know, how's it feel to be under my skin",
