{"lyrics": "\"Breathless\"\nHere you are now\nFresh from your war\nBack from the edge of time\nAnd all that you were\nStripped to the bone\nI thought you'\u00add want to know\nThat when you feel the world is crashing\nAll around your feet\nCome running headlong into my arms\nBreathless\nI'll never judge you\nI can only love you\nCome now running headlong\nInto my arms\nBreathless\nLay down your guns\nToo weak to run\nNothing can harm you here\nYour precious heart\nBroken and scarred\nSomehow you made it through\nI only ask that you won't go again\nWhen you feel the world is crashing\nAll around your feet\nCome running headlong into my arms\nBreathless\nI'll never judge you\nI can only love you\nCome now running headlong\nInto my arms\nBreathless\nI'm so glad to see you smiling\nSo good to hear your laugh\nI think that you've found you even\nMissed yourself\nI'm only asking this because I think that\nTruth be told\nOh, you'll never go again\nAgain\nWhen you feel the world is crashing\nAll around your feet\nCome running headlong into my arms\nBreathless\nI'll never judge you\nI can only love you\nCome now running headlong\nInto my arms\nBreathless\nBreathless", "title": "Breathless", "year": null, "album": null}
