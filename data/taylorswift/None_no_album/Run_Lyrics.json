  "lyrics": "(originally by George Strait)\nThere's a plane or a bus leaving Dallas\nI hope you're on it\nIf there's a train moving fast down the tracks\nI hope you caught it\n'Cause I swear out there ain't where\nYou outta be\nSo catch a ride or catch a cab\nDon't you know that I miss you bad\nBut don't you walk to me\nBaby run cut a path across the blue sky\nStraight in a straight line\nYou can't get here fast enough\nFind a truck and fire it up\nLean on the gas and off the clutch\nLeave Dallas in the dust\nI need you in a rush\nSo baby run\nSo baby run\nOh if you ain't got a suitcase\nGet a box\nOr an old brown paper sack\nPack it light or pack it heavy\nTake a truck, take a Chevy\nBaby just come back\nThere's a shortcut to the highway out of town\nWhy don't you take it\nDon't let that speed limit slow you down\nGo on and break it\nBaby break it\nBaby run\nCut a path across the blue sky\nStraight in a straight line\nYou can't get here fast enough\nFind a truck and fire it up\nLean on the gas and off the clutch\nLeave Dallas in the dust\nI need you in a rush\nSo baby run\nRun to me\nBaby run\nRun to me\nSo baby run\nRun\nOh baby run",
