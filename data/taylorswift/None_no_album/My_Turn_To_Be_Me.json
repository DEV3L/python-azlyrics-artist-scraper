{"lyrics": "\"My Turn To Be Me\"\nSomething about me didn't fit into your perfect world\nI bet the bluegrass stained your smile\nYou should use a darker color when you write on the wall\nI haven't read it a thousand times\nMaybe if you saw me for a second you would realize\nHoney I was trying so hard\nTo talk, walk, think, stop\nAnytime you want me to\nBend all my rules\nI used to let you choose\nWho you wanted me to be\nThis time I'm flying free\nIt's my turn to be me\nYou liked the face but you had to replace me\nInside I saw the walls of me go down\nYou can take the girl away from\nCowboy hats and steel guitars\nShe'll still sing the same old songs\nMaybe if you saw me for a second you would realize\nHoney I was trying so hard\nTo talk, walk, think, stop\nAnytime you want me to\nBend all my rules\nI used to let you choose\nWho you wanted me to be\nThis time I'm flying free\nIt's my turn to be me\nTurned on that radio\nHey that's when I realized\nIt wasn't our song, it was yours\nAnd in conversation baby I was decoration\nNow I deserve a little bit more than\nTo talk, walk, think, stop\nAnytime you want me to\nBend all my rules\nI used to let you choose\nWho you wanted me to be\nThis time I'm flying free\nIt's my turn to be me\nIt's my turn to be me", "title": "My Turn To Be Me", "year": null, "album": null}
