{"lyrics": "\"Spinning Around\"\nDays go by, I wonder if you here me\nCan't you read between the lines?\nNow I'm standing still, I am disappearing \nTake this chance, I'll make you mine\nDon't you wonder why\nYou change in time\nMakes you feel so empty inside\nBut love's got me cornered in the back of the room\nI'm spinning around, I'm spinning around\nAnd all I see is someone I don't know\nLove's got me tangled, tired me too\nNo sign of a wall, sign of wall,\nSpinning me around\nAnd baby all I see is you\nHe tells lies, are you really thinking\nThat you deserve another try\nWhen you see these eyes\nYou see another planet\nDon't ask how, but fate decides\nDon't you wonder why\nYou change in time\nMakes you feel so empty inside\nBut love's got me cornered in the back of the room\nI'm spinning around, I'm spinning around\nAnd all I see is someone I don't know\nLove's got me tangled, tired me too\nNo sign of a wall, sign of wall,\nSpinning me around\nAnd baby all I see is you\nSpinning and turning\nAnd living and learning\nI should be able to handle this\nMake it or break it\nMove it or shake it\nDo it or fake it\nGirl you've got to make it\nBut love's got me cornered in the back of the room\nI'm spinning around, I'm spinning around\nAnd all I see is someone I don't know\nLove's got me tangled, tired me too\nNo sign of a wall, sign of wall,\nSpinning me around\nAnd baby all I see is you\nSpinning me around\nAnd baby all I see is you\nSpinning me around\nAnd all I see is you", "title": "Spinning Around", "year": null, "album": null}
