  "lyrics": "I remember your bare feet down the hallway\nI remember your little laugh\nRace cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs\nI love you to the moon and back\nI remember your blue eyes looking into mine\nLike we had our own secret club\nI remember you dancing before bed time\nThen jumping on me, waking me up\nI can still feel you hold my hand, little man\nAnd even the moment I knew\nYou fought it hard like an army guy\nRemember I leaned in and whispered to you\nCome on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here\nYou were my best four years\nI remember the drive home\nWhen the blind hope turned to crying and screaming \"Why?\"\nFlowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say\nAbout a beautiful boy who died\nAnd it's about to be Halloween\nYou could be anything you wanted if you were still here\nI remember the last day when I kissed your face\nAnd whispered in your ear\nCome on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here\nOut of this curtained room in this hospital grey, we'll just disappear\nCome on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here\nYou were my best four years\nWhat if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?\nWhat if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?\nAnd what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?\nWhat if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?\nCome on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here\nCome on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here\nYou were my best four years\nI remember your bare feet down the hallway\nI love you to the moon and back",
