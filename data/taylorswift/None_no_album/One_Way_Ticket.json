{"lyrics": "Standing on the border\nLooking out into the great unknown\nI can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own\nThere's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind\nI'm heading out tonight, traveling light\nI'm gonna start all over again\nAnd buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train\nSee how far I can go\nCause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain\nAnd talk to someone I don't know\nI will face the world around me\nKnowing that I'm strong enough to let you go\nAnd I will fall in love again\nBecause I can\nGonna climb the mountain\nAnd look the eagle in the eye\nI won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly\nHow could I have ever believed\nThat love had to be so blind\nWhen freedom was waiting, down at the station\nAll I had to do was make up my mind\nAnd buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train\nSee how far I can go\nCause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain\nAnd talk to someone I don't know\nI will face the world around me\nKnowing that I'm strong enough to let you go\nAnd I will fall in love again\nBecause I can\nWell, I have walked through the fire\nAnd crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt\nThen the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out\nBuy a one-way ticket on a west bound train\nSee how far I can go\nCause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain\nAnd talk to someone I don't know\nBuy a one-way ticket on a west bound train\nI'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne\nGonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings\nGonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything", "title": "One Way Ticket", "album": null, "year": null}
