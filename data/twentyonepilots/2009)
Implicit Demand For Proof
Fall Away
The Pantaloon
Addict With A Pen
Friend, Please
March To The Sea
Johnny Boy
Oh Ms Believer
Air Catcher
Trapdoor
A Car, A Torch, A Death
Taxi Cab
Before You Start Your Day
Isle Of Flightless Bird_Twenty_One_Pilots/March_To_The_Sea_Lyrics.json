  "lyrics": "And I'll fall in line\nA stranger's back is all I see\nHe's only a few feet in front of me\nAnd I'll look left and right sometimes\nBut I'll fall in line\nNo one looks up anymore\n'Cause you might get a raindrop in your eye\nAnd Heaven forbid they see you cry\nAs we fall in line\nAnd about this time of every year\nThe line will go to the ocean pier\nAnd walk right off into the sea\nAnd then we fall asleep\nAnd as we're near the end of land\nAnd our ocean graves are just beyond the sand\nI ask myself the question\nWhy I fall in line\nThen out of the corner of my eye\nI see a spaceship in the sky\nAnd hear a voice inside my head:\nFollow me instead\nFollow me instead\nFollow me\nThen the wages of war will start\nInside my head with my counterpart\nAnd the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase:\nThis line's the only way\nAnd then I start down the sand\nMy eyes are focused on the end of land\nBut again the voice inside my head says\nFollow me instead\nFollow me instead\nFollow me\nFollow me instead\nFollow me instead\nFollow me instead\nFollow me instead\nFollow me instead\nTake me up, seal the door\nI don't want to march here anymore\nI realize that this line is dead\nSo I'll follow You instead\nSo then You put me back in my place\nSo I might start another day\nAnd once again I will be\nIn a march to the sea",
