  "lyrics": "'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away\nI don't wanna fall, fall away\nI don't, I don't wanna fall, fall away\nI will keep the lights on in this place\n'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away\nI disguise\nAnd I will lie\nAnd I will take my precious time\nAs the days melt away\nAs I stand in line\nAnd I die as I wait as I wait on my crime\nAnd I'll try to delay what you make of my life\nBut I don't want your way,\nI want mine\nI'm dying and I'm trying\nBut believe me I'm fine\nBut I'm lying,\nI'm so very far from fine\nAnd I, I can feel the pull begin\nFeel my conscience wearing thin\nAnd my skin\nIt will start to break up and fall apart\nI don't wanna fall, fall away\nI don't wanna fall, fall away\nI will keep the lights on in this place\n'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away\nEvery time I feel selfish ambition\nIs taking my vision\nMy crime is my sentence\nRepentance is taking commission\nIt's taking a toll\nOn my soul\nI'm screaming submission and,\nI don't know if I am dying or living\n'Cause I will save face\nFor name's sake\nAbuse grace\nTake aim to obtain a new name\nAnd a newer place\nBut my name is lame\nI can't walk and I ain't the same\nAnd my name became\nNew destiny to the grave\nAnd I, I can feel the pull begin\nFeel my conscience wearing thin\nAnd my skin,\nIt will start to break up and fall apart\nI don't wanna fall, fall away\nI don't wanna fall, fall away\nI will keep the lights on in this place\n'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away",
