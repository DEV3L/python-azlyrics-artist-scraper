  "lyrics": "But now he just uses one he saw on a grave\nHe pretends that he's OK\nBut you should see\nHim in bed late at night\nHe's petrified\nTake me out and finish this waste of a life\nEveryone gather around for a show\nWatch as this man disappears as we know\nDo me a favor and try to ignore\nAs you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor\nHe thinks that faith might be dead\nNothing kills a man faster than his own head\nHe used to see dreams at night\nBut now he's just watching the backs of his eyes\nHe pretends he's OK\nBut you should see\nHim in bed late at night\nHe's petrified\nTake me out and finish this waste of a life\nEveryone gather around for a show\nWatch as this man disappears as we know\nDo me a favor and try to ignore\nAs you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor\nTake me out and finish this waste of a life\nEveryone gather around for a show\nWatch as this man disappears as we know\nDo me a favor and try to ignore\nWhen you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor\n'Cause nobody knows he's alive",
