  "lyrics": "But this time he decides that it's alright.\nIt's alright.\nNo one really knows his mind\nAnd no one knows behind his eyes\nThe man deserves a medal,\nBut he's never really won a prize\nBefore.\nHe goes to lock the door.\nHe has fallen in love.\nHe knows it's enough.\nBut the world looks down and frowns.\nGet up, Johnny boy, get up, Johnny boy,\nGet up 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground.\nYou're my pride and joy,\nYou're my pride and joy.\nGet up, Johnny boy, because we all need you now.\nWe all need you now.\nSomeone said, \"Away you go.\"\nAnd someone said to you, \"Goodbye.\"\nThey deflect\nThe disrespect\nWhen they say that they blame it on the times.\nThey blame it on the time.\nWe all know you're qualified\nTo fix a chair and love your wife.\nThey all know you're qualified\nBut they lie when they blame it on the times.\nOh, we blame it on the times.\nHe has fallen in love.\nHe knows it's enough.\nBut the world looks down and frowns.\nGet up, Johnny boy, get up, Johnny boy,\nGet up 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground.\nYou're my pride and joy,\nYou're my pride and joy.\nGet up, Johnny boy, because we all need you now.\nWe all need you now.\nI will carry all your names\nAnd I will carry all your shame.\nAnd I will carry all your names\nAnd I will carry all your shame.\nAnd I will carry all your names\nAnd I will carry all your shame.\n[2x]\nGet up, Johnny boy, get up, Johnny boy,\nGet up 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground.\nYou're my pride and joy,\nYou're my pride and joy.\nGet up, Johnny boy, because we all need you now.",
