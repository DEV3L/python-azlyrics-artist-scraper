  "lyrics": "The air begins to feel a little thin\nAs I start the car and then I begin\nTo add the miles piled up behind me\nI barely feel a smile deep inside me\nAnd I begin to envy the headlights driving south\nI want to crack the door so I can just fall out\nBut then I remember when you packed my car\nYou reached in the back and buckled up your heart\nFor me to drive away with\nI began to understand\nWhy God died\nThe demon sat there waiting on her porch\nIt was a little dark so he held a makeshift torch\nAnd when my car was far out of sight\nHe crept in her room and stayed there for the night\n[2x]\nAnd then I felt chills in my bones\nThe breath I saw was not my own\nI knew my skin that wrapped my frame\nWasn't made to play this game\nAnd then I saw Him, torch in hand\nHe laid it out, what he had planned\nAnd then I said, I'll take the grave\nPlease, just send them all my way\nI began to understand\nWhy God died\nThe air begins to feel a little thin\nAs we're waiting for the morning to begin\nBut for now you told me to hold this jar\nAnd when I looked inside, I saw\nIt held your heart\nFor me to walk away with\nI began to understand\nWhy God died",
