{"year": "2009", "lyrics": "Now is the climax to the story\nThat gives the demons and angels purpose\nThey fly around while we are walking\nAnd mold our emotions just to please them\nI am cold, can you hear?\nI will fly with no hope, no fear\nAnd the ground taunts my wings\nPlummet as I sing, plummet as I sing\nAll we are is an isle of flightless birds\nWe find our worth in giving birth and stuff\nWe're lining our homes against winding roads\nAnd we think the going is tough\nWe pick songs to sing, remind us of things that nobody cares about\nAnd honestly we're probably more suicidal than ever now\nIf you decide to live by, what you think's wrong and what's right\nBelieve me you'll begin to wish you were sleeping\nYour weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry\nBut if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe\nWe can take apart our very heart and the light will set us free\nI am cold, can you hear?\nI will fly with no hope, no fear\nAnd the ground taunts my wings\nPlummet as I sing, plummet as I...\nI am cold, can you hear?\nI will fly with no hope, no fear\nAnd the ground taunts my wings\nPlummet as I sing, plummet as I sing\nHow frustrating and so degrading\nHis time, we're wasting\nAs time will fly by and the sky will cry as light is fading\nAnd he is waiting, oh so patiently\nWhile we repeat the same routine as we will please comfortability\nPlease don't think about why you can't sleep in the evening\nAnd please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking\nYour soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides\nAnd it's time you pick your battle, and I promise you this is mine\n(I promise you)", "title": "Isle Of Flightless Birds", "album": "Twenty One Pilots"}
