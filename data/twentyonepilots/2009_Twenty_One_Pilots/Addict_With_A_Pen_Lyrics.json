  "lyrics": "Hello\nWe haven't talked in quite some time\nI know\nI haven't been the best\nOf sons\nHello\nI've been traveling in\nThe desert of my mind\nAnd I\nHaven't found a drop\nOf life\nI haven't found a drop\nOf you\nI haven't found a drop\nI haven't found a drop\nOf water\nWater\nI try desperately to run through the sand\nAs I hold the water\nIn the palm of my hand\nCause it's all that I have\nAnd it's all that I need and\nThe waves of the water\nMean nothing to me\nBut I try my best\nAnd all that I can to\nHold tightly onto\nWhat's left in my hand\nBut no matter how\nHow tightly I will strain\nThe sand will slow me down\nAnd the water will drain\nI'm just being dramatic\nIn fact,\nI'm only at it again\nAs an addict with a pen\nWho's addicted to the wind\nAs it blows me back and forth\nMindless, spineless, and pretend\nOf course I'll be here again\nSee you tomorrow\nBut it's the end of today\nEnd of my ways\nAs a walking denial\nMy trial was filed as a crazy\nSuicidal head case\nBut you specialize in dying\nYou hear me screaming, \"Father,\"\nAnd I'm lying here just crying\nSo wash me with your water\nWater\nHello\nWe haven't talked in quite some time\nI know\nI haven't been the best\nOf sons\nHello\nI've been traveling in\nThe desert of my mind\nAnd I\nI haven't found a drop\nOf life\nI haven't found a drop\nOf you\nI haven't found a drop\nI haven't found a drop\nOf water",
