  "lyrics": "I feel for you, but when did you believe you were alone?\nYou say that spiders crawled inside and made themselves a home\nWhere light once was\nPetrified of who you are and who you have become\nYou will hide from everyone, denying you need someone\nTo exterminate your bones\nFriend, please remove your hands from\nOver your eyes for me\nI know you want to leave but\nFriend, please don't take your life away from me\nLiving like a ghost you walk by everyone you know\nYou say that you're fine but you have lost your sway and glow\nSo I stopped by to let you know\nFriend, please remove your hands from\nOver your eyes for me\nI know you want to leave but\nFriend, please don't take your life away from me\nWould you let me know your plans tonight?\n'Cause I just won't let go 'til we both see the light\nAnd I have nothing else left to say\nBut I will listen to you all day, yes I will\nFriend, please remove your hands from\nOver your eyes for me\nI know you want to leave but\nFriend, please don't take your life away from me",
