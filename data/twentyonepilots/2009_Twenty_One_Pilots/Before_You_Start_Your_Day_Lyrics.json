  "lyrics": "Open the slits in your face and start your day\nYou don't have much time to make your slits look just right\nI'm in your mind\nI'm singing\nI'm in your mind\nI'm singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da da\nLook in the mirror and ask your soul if you're alright\nPut on the glitter that your soul hides behind\nYou're in my mind\nI'm singing\nYou're in my mind\nI'm singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da da\nKnow you were made holy\nOpen up your eyes and see\nThe clouds above will hold you\nThe clouds above will sing\nAh\nAnd in your mind\nYou're singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da da",
