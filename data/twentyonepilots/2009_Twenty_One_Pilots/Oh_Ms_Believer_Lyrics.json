  "lyrics": "Oh, Ms. Believer, my pretty sleeper\nYour twisted mind is like snow on the road\nYour shaking shoulders prove that it's colder\nInside your head than the winter of dead\nI will tell you I love you\nBut the muffs on your ears will cater your fears\nMy nose and feet are running as we start\nTo travel through snow\nTogether we go\nTogether we go\nWe get colder\nAs we grow older\nWe will walk\nSo much slower\nOh, Ms. Believer, my pretty weeper\nYour twisted thoughts are like snow on the rooftops\nPlease, take my hand, we're in foreign land\nAs we travel through snow\nTogether we go\nTogether we go\nWe get colder\nAs we grow older\nWe will walk\nSo much slower",
