  "lyrics": "(Old Songs Medley)\n[The Pantaloon]\nYour grandpa died\nWhen you were nine\nThey said he had\nLost his mind\nYou have learned\nWay too soon\nYou should never trust the pantaloon\nYou are tired\nYou are hurt\nA moth ate through\nYour favorite shirt\nAnd all your friends fertilize\nThe ground you walk\nLose your mind\n[Semi-Automatic]\nI'm never what I like\nI'm double-sided\nAnd I just can't hide\nI kinda like it\nWhen I make you cry\nCause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind\n[Forest]\nDown in the forest, we'll sing a chorus\nOne that everybody knows\nHands held higher, we'll be on fire\nSinging songs that nobody wrote\nDown in the forest, we'll sing a chorus\nOne that everybody knows\nHands held higher, we'll be on fire\nSinging songs that nobody wrote\n[Screen]\nI'm standing in front of You\nI'm standing in front of You\nI'm trying to be so cool\nEverything together trying to be so cool\nI'm standing in front of You\nI'm standing in front of You\nI'm trying to be so cool\nEverything together trying to be so cool\n(Trying to be so cool, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)\n[Ode To Sleep]\nBut I tell 'em\nWhy won't you let me go\nDo I threaten all your plans?\nI'm insignificant\nPlease tell 'em\nYou have no plans for me\nI will set my soul on fire\nWhat have I become?\nI'll tell 'em\n[Addict With a Pen]\nHello, we haven't talked in quite some time\nI know I haven't been the best of sons\nHello, I've been traveling in the deserts of my mind\nAnd I haven't found a drop\nI tried desperately to run through the sand as I\nHold the water in the palm of my hand\nCause it's all that I have and it's all that I need and\nThe waves of the water mean nothing to me\nBut I tried my best and all that I can to\nHold tightly onto what's left in my hand\nBut no matter how, how tightly I will strain\nThe sand will slow me down and the water will drain\nI'm just being dramatic\nIn fact\nI'm only at it again\nAs an addict with a pen\nWho's addicted to the wind\nAs it blows me back and forth\nMindless, spineless, and pretend\nOf course I'll be here again\nSee you tomorrow\nBut it's the end of today\nEnd of my ways\nAs a walking denial\nMy trial was filed\nAs a crazy suicidal head case\nBut you specialize in dying\nYou hear me screaming \"Father\"\nAnd I'm lying here just crying\nSo wash me with your water\n[Screen]\nWe're broken\nWe're broken\nWe're broken\nWe're broken people, oh\nWe're broken people, oh, yeah\nWe're broken",
