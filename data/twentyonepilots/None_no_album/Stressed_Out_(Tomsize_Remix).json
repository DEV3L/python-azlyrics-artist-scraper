{"album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "\"Stressed Out (Tomsize Remix)\"\nI wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard,\nI wish I had a better voice that sang some better words,\nI wish I found some chords in an order that is new,\nI wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang,\nI was told when I get older all my fears would shrink,\nBut now I'm insecure and I care what people think.\nMy name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.\nMy name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.\nWish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.\n...now we're stressed out.\nSometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young,\nHow come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from,\nI'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it,\nTry to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one,\nIt'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose,\nSame clothes homegrown a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam,\nBut it would remind us of when nothing really mattered,\nOut of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter.\n...my, my, my, my name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.\nMy name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.\nWish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.\n...now we're stressed out.\nWe used to play pretend, give each other different names,\nWe would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away,\nUsed to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face,\nSaying, \"Wake up, you need to make money.\"\nYo.\nWe used to play pretend, give each other different names,\nWe would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away,\nUsed to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face,\nSaying, \"Wake up, you need to make money.\"\nYo.\nWish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.\nWish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.\nUsed to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny\nWe used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money\nUsed to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny\nWe used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money\ngive each other different names,\nWe would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away,\nUsed to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face,\nSaying, \"Wake up, you need to make money.\"\nYo.", "title": "Stressed Out (Tomsize Remix)"}
