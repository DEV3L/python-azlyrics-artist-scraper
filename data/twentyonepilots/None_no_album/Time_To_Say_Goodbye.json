{"year": null, "lyrics": "You split\nAnd take in every time you see\nA faking counterfeit\nIn the mirror you appear\nTo see fear\nAnd whisper this is it\nIn the mirror you appear\nTo see nothing else\nBut yourself as a face\nA hollowed out space\nLeave me with the razor\nAnd just in case\nI fall face down on the ground\nAnd somehow I found\nEnough strength to lift my face\nAnd make a sound\nAnd muffled though it may be\nAnd crazy it seems\nI never felt closer to you\nJust crying as you torture me\nIt's time to say goodbye\nTo the earth and now my worthless life\n'Cause everything I've ever made\nIs dead now\nInside the grave\nIt's time to say goodbye\nTo the earth and now my worthless life\n'Cause everything I've ever made\nIs dead now\nInside the grave\nI just don't wanna be\nSo many things\nAnd now that I see\nI just wanna sing\nI just wanna breathe\nI just wanna fly\nI just wanna close my eyes\nAnd take in the sun\nAnd take in the air\nI just wanna run\nAnd murder my care\nI wanna believe that I will be free elsewhere\nAnd I'm standing on a tower\nTrying my hardest to make it\nTo you but I built this tower\nOut of mortal bricks\nThey're breaking\nI truly will surrender\nMy pretender\nMy disguise\nAnd I'll truly start to\nRender to your splendor\nSo it's time to say goodbye\nIt's time to say goodbye\nTo the earth and now my worthless life\n'Cause everything I've ever made\nIs dead now\nInside the grave\nIt's time to say goodbye\nTo the earth and now my worthless life\n'Cause everything I've ever made\nIs dead now\nInside the grave\nIt's time to say goodbye\nTo the earth and now my worthless life\n'Cause everything I've ever made\nIs dead now\nInside the grave", "title": "Time To Say Goodbye", "album": null}
