  "lyrics": "They said he had lost his mind\nYou have learned\nWay too soon\nYou should never trust the Pantaloon\nNow it's your turn\nTo be alone\nFind a wife and build yourself a home\nYou have learned\nWay too soon\nThat your dad is now the Pantaloon\nYou are tired\nYou are hurt\nA moth ate through\nYour favorite shirt\nAnd all your friends\nFertilize\nThe ground you walk\nLose your mind\nHe's seen too many stare downs\nBetween the sun and the moon\nIn the morning air\nHow he used to hustle all the people\nWalking through the fairgrounds\nHe's been around so long\nHe's changed his meaning of a chair now\nBecause a chair now,\nIs like a tiny island in the sea of all the people\nWho glide across the very surface\nThat made his bones feeble\nThe end can't come soon enough\nBut is it too soon?\nEither way he can't deny\nHe is a Pantaloon\nYou are tired\nYou are hurt\nA moth ate through\nYour favorite shirt\nAnd all your friends\nFertilize\nThe ground you walk\nLose your mind\nYou like to sleep alone\nIt's colder than you know\n'Cause your skin is so used to colder bones\nIt's warmer in the morning\nThan what it is at night\nYour bones are held together\nBy your nightmares and your frights\nYou are tired\nYou are hurt\nA moth ate through\nYour favorite shirt\nAnd all your friends\nThey fertilize\nThe ground you walk\nSo lose your mind\nYou are tired\nYou are hurt\nA moth ate through\nYour favorite shirt\nAnd all your friends\nThey fertilize\nThe ground you walk\nLose your mind",
