Take it slow\nWait for them to ask you who you know\nPlease don't make any sudden moves\nYou don't know the half of the abuse\nAll my friends are heathens. Take it slow\nWait for them to ask you who you know\nPlease don't make any sudden moves\nYou don't know the half of the abuse\nWelcome to the room of people\nWho have rooms of people that they loved one day\nDocked away\nJust because we check the guns at the door\nDoesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades\nYou'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you\nYou'll never know the murderer sitting next to you\nYou'll think, \"How'd I get here, sitting next to you?\"\nBut after all I've said\nPlease don't forget\nAll my friends are heathens. Take it slow\nWait for them to ask you who you know\nPlease don't make any sudden moves\nYou don't know the half of the abuse\nWe don't deal with outsiders very well\nThey say newcomers have a certain smell\nYou have trust issues, not to mention\nThey say they can smell your intentions\nYou'll never know the freakshow sitting next to you\nYou'll have some weird people sitting next to you\nYou'll think, \"How'd I get here, sitting next to you?\"\nBut after all I've said\nPlease don't forget\n(Watch it, watch it)\nAll my friends are heathens. Take it slow\nWait for them to ask you who you know\nPlease don't make any sudden moves\nYou don't know the half of the abuse\nAll my friends are heathens. Take it slow\n(Watch it)\nWait for them to ask you who you know\n(Watch it)\nPlease, all my friends are heathens. Take it slow\n(Watch it)\nWait for them to ask you who you know\nWhy'd you come? You knew you should have stayed\n(It's blasphemy)\nI tried to warn you just to stay away\n(Away)\nAnd now they're outside ready to bust\n(To bust)\nIt looks like you might be one of us", "title": "Heathens"}
