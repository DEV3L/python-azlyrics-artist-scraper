  "lyrics": "That kept me safe and sound\nMy parachutes will guide me\nSafely to ground\nBut now the cord's not working\nAnd I see you staring me down\nI won't fall in\nLove with falling\nI will try to avoid\nThose eyes\nI think you would beat\nThe moon in a pretty contest\nAnd the moon just happened to be\nThe very first thing that I missed\nI was doing fine on my own\nAnd there wasn't much I lacked\nBut you've stolen my air catcher\nAnd I don't know if I want it back\nI won't fall in\nLove with falling\nI will try to avoid\nThose eyes\n'Cause I'm not sure\nI want to give you\nTools that can destroy\nMy heart\nAnd I just don't say\nWhat you want to hear\nSo I'll write my fears\nAnd I don't believe\nIn talking just to breathe\nAnd falling selfishly\nI won't fall in\nLove with falling\nI will try to avoid\nThose eyes\nBut now I'm here\nTo give you words\nAs tools that can destroy\nMy heart",
