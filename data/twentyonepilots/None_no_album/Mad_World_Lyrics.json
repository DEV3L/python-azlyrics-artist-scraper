  "lyrics": "(originally by Tears For Fears)\nAll around me are familiar faces\nWorn out places, worn out faces\nBright and early for the daily races\nGoing nowhere, going nowhere\nTheir tears are filling up their glasses\nNo expression, no expression\nHide my head I wanna drown my sorrow\nNo tomorrow, no tomorrow\nAnd I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad\nThe dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had\nI find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take\nWhen people run in circles, it's a very very\nMad world\nMad world\nMad world",
