{"lyrics": "Silent in the trees.\nWhy won't you speak\nWhere I happen to be?\nSilent in the trees\nStanding cowardly.\nI can feel your breath.\nI can feel my death.\nI want to know you.\nI want to see.\nI want to say hello.\nHello. Hello-oh-o. Hello.\nNa na, na na na nah na na. [4x]\nI know where you stand\nSilent in the trees\nAnd that's where I am\nSilent in the trees.\nWhy won't you speak\nWhere I happen to be?\nSilent in the trees\nStanding cowardly.\nI can feel your breath.\nI can feel my death.\nI want to know you.\nI want to see.\nI want to say hello.\nNa na, na na na nah na na. [2x]\nHello, hello.\nNa na, na na na nah na na. [2x]\nHello, hello.\nHello, hello. [2x]", "album": "Regional At Best", "year": "2011", "title": "Trees Lyrics"}
