{"album": "Regional At Best", "year": "2011", "lyrics": "\"Clear\"\nI wish that I had two faces to prove which theory works,\nYelling on the street corner or cleverly masking your words,\nI take my face off at the door 'cause I don't know who they will take me for,\nI wonder if I tell them what I did last night,\nWhether or not I got caught, they just might,\nWage war on you, therefore it's true,\nThat I shot my general on my side of enemy lines.\n[2x]\nI'm the son of all I've done,\nI'm the son of all I've done,\nImpostor, been fostered, then my new father drained my dirty blood.\nI'm not trying to be lying to you,\nBut it takes a clever guy to do what I do,\nIt takes some chivalry and well placed energy,\nTo subliminally get yourself inside you,\nIntrospection is the name of this session,\nSpread this infection, reflect it on the next one,\nThe next one, the next one, and when we're done,\nWe'll all have made something new under the sun,\nI'm not done, I'm not done yet, no,\nKick me off the stage and take my microphone,\nThen you'll walk up to me and when you get close,\nI'll look you in the face and say, \"Where's your home?\nWhere are you going and why are you here?\"\nHave you asked these questions? Have you been sincere?\nWant to know what I believe? It's right here,\nDig a little deeper and it's crystal clear.\n[2x]\nI'm the son of all I've done,\nI'm the son of all I've done,\nImpostor, been fostered, then my new father drained my dirty blood.\n[x3]\nI will tell you what I can,\nBut your mind will take a stand,\nI sing of a greater love,\nLet me know when you've had enough.", "title": "Clear"}
