  "lyrics": "I'm taking over my body,\nBack in control, no more shotty,\nI bet a lot of me was lost,\nTs uncrossed and Is undotted,\nI fought it a lot\nAnd it seems a lot like flesh is all I got,\nNot anymore, flesh out the door,\nSwat,\nI must've forgot, you can't trust me,\nI'm open a moment and close when you show it,\nBefore you know it, I'm lost at sea,\nAnd now that I write and think about it,\nAnd the story unfolds,\nYou should take my life,\nYou should take my soul.\nYou are surrounding all my surroundings,\nSounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain,\nYou are surrounding all my surroundings,\nTwisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.\nAnd I'll be holding on to you [2x]\nRemember the moment\nYou know exactly where you're going,\n'Cause the next moment,\nBefore you know it, time is slowing\nAnd it's frozen still,\nAnd the window sill looks really nice, right?\nYou think twice about your life,\nIt probably happens at night,\nRight?\nFight it,\nTake the pain, ignite it,\nTie a noose around your mind\nLoose enough to breathe fine and tie it\nTo a tree. Tell it, \"You belong to me.\nThis ain't a noose, this is a leash.\nAnd I have news for you: you must obey me.\"\nYou are surrounding all my surroundings,\nSounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain,\nYou are surrounding all my surroundings,\nTwisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.\nEntertain my faith. [10x]\n[4x]\nLean with it, rock with it,\nWhen we gonna stop with it,\nLyrics that mean nothing,\nWe were gifted with thought,\nIs it time to move our feet\nTo an introspective beat,\nIt ain't the speakers that bump hearts,\nIt's our hearts that make the beat.\nAnd I'll be holding on to you. [8x]",
