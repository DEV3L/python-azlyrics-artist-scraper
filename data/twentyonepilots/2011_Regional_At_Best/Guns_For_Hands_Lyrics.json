  "lyrics": "I know what you think in the morning,\nWhen the sun shines on the ground,\nAnd shows what you have done,\nIt shows where your mind has gone,\nAnd you swear to your parents,\nThat it will never happen again,\nI know, I know what that means, I know.\nThat you all have guns,\nAnd you never put the safety on,\nAnd you all have plans,\nTo take it, to take it,\nDon't take it, take it, take it.\nI'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,\nI'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,\nBut I can't, but I can't\nWhen you all have guns for hands, yeah\nI'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,\nI'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,\nBut I can't, but I can't\nWhen you all have guns for hands, yeah\nLet's take this a second at a time,\nLet's take this one song, this one rhyme,\nTogether, let's breathe,\nTogether, to the beat,\nBut there's hope out the window,\nSo that's where we'll go,\nLet's go outside and all join hands,\nBut until then you'll never understand.\nThat you all have guns,\nAnd you never put the safety on,\nAnd you all have plans,\nTo take it, to take it,\nDon't take it, take it, take it.\nI'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,\nI'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,\nBut I can't, but I can't\nWhen you all have guns for hands, yeah.\n(hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)\n(hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)\n(hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)\n[4x]\n(la, da, da, da, da)\nWe've turned our hands to guns, trade in our thumbs for ammunition,\nI must forewarn you of my disorder, or my condition,\n'Cause when the sun sets, it upsets what's left of my invested interest,\nInterested in putting my fingers to my head,\nThe solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids,\nFused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this,\nSimply suggest my chest and this confused music,\nIt's obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist.\nI'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,\nI'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,\nBut I can't, but I can't\nWhen you all have guns for hands, yeah.\nI'm trying, I'm trying to sleep (I'm trying to sleep)\nI'm trying, I'm trying to sleep (I'm trying to sleep)\nBut I can't, but I can't\nWhen you all have (when you all have) guns for hands, yeah.",
