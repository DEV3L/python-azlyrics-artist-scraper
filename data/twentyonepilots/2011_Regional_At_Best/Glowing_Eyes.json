{"album": "Regional At Best", "year": "2011", "lyrics": "\"Glowing Eyes\"\nWe all are stranger creatures than when we all started out as kids,\nCulture forbids,\nWe have romantic fantasies about what dying truly is,\nFall off the grid.\nWe live for the night's decor,\nIt reveals what we dream of.\nI know there's someone at the door,\nThey called for help, of this I'm sure,\nBut do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes,\nI'm holding on to what I know,\nAnd what I know, I must let go,\nBut I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along.\nWe all know somebody who knows somebody who's doing great,\nI know some people who know people who are flying straight,\nBut I'll kindly enter into rooms of depression,\nWhile ceiling fans and idle hands will take my life again.\nWe live for the night's decor,\nIt reveals what we dream of.\nI know there's someone at the door,\nThey called for help, of this I'm sure,\nBut do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes,\nI'm holding on to what I know,\nAnd what I know, I must let go,\nBut I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along.\n[x2:]\nThis room is far too dark for us to stay around,\nRedemption's not that far and darkness is going down.\nI'm holding on to what I know,\nAnd what I know, I must let go,\nBut I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along\nFor the eyes to sing along\nMake them stop [x5]", "title": "Glowing Eyes"}
