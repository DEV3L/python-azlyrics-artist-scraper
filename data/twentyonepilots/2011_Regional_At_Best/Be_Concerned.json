{"year": "2011", "lyrics": "Where'd you go, huh?\nThey all think I know you,\nIt's so hard to motivate,\nMe to devote a,\nSingle inch of me to,\nSomething I can't see I,\nDon't mean to pry but why,\nWould you even make the eyes?\nI don't believe my ears,\nAnd I'm scared of my own head,\nI will deny you for years,\nThen I'll make you raise me from the dead,\nAnd if I said that I would live for you,\nFor nothing in return,\nWell I'm sorry Mr. Gullible,\nBut lying's all I've learned,\nSo be concerned. [2x]\n[Jocef:]\nNo music,\nAnd I could talk about anything,\nWhether or not it's worth while,\nIt's based on who's listening,\nMost of us listen if it's,\nSomething we can relate to,\nAll of us relate,\nIf it's something we've just been through,\nTake it for granted,\nTrust is damaged and now we panic,\nLiving empty-handed,\nLiving lives like we can't manage, I can't feel you,\nBut still know where home is feeling like Jonah did,\nAlmost dropped the bat like every base was fully loaded.\nSo be concerned. [2x]\nI am disappearing,\nInside my bird's eye theories,\nI try to say goodbye, defy, and deny,\nWhat it is I'm fearing,\nClearly I am dying, dearly I am writing,\nMerely testifying, that the test to fly requires I,\nPass the test with colors flying,\nI don't believe you most the time,\nI'm lying 'cause I say I am fine,\nYou are the pearl, I am the swine,\nSo break my life and take this rhyme,\nI'm so sorry but I do believe,\nThat all my bridges, I have burned,\nAnd I've earned a policy of no return,\nSo be concerned.
