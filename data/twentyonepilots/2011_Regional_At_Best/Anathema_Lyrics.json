  "lyrics": "So won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye\nYou will never know what's under my skin\nSo won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye\nYou will never know what is in my veins\nSo won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye\nWon't you go to someone else's dreams?\nWon't you go to someone else's head?\nHaven't you taken enough from me?\nWon't you torture someone else's sleep?\nAnd you will never know what I'm thinking of\nSo won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye\nAnd you will never understand what I believe\nSo won't you say goodnight, so I can say goodbye\nHaven't you taken enough from me?\nWon't you torture someone else's sleep?\nWon't you go to someone else's dreams?\nWon't you go to someone else's head?\nHaven't you taken enough from me?\nWon't you torture someone else's sleep?\nI start to part\nTwo halves of my heart\nIn the dark and I\nDon't know\nWhere I should go\nAnd the tears\nAnd the fears\nBegin to multiply\nTaking time in a simple place\nIn my bed\nWhere my head\nRests on a pillowcase\nAnd it's said\nThat a war's led\nBut I forget\nThat I let another day go by\nI wanna be afraid but it seems\nThat these days I'm caught under water\nAnd I'm falling farther\nMy heart's getting harder,\nI'm calling my father\nAm I screaming to an empty sky?\nEmpty sky, no way, that's me\n'Cause one half of my heart is free\nEmpty sky, no way, that's me,\n'Cause the other half of my heart's asleep",
