  "lyrics": "Nobody thinks what I think,\nNobody dreams when they blink\nThink things on the brink of blasphemy\nI'm my own shrink\nThink things are after me, my catastrophe\nAt my kitchen sink,\nYou don't know what that means\nBecause a kitchen sink to you\nIs not a kitchen sink to me, OK friend?\nAre you searching for purpose?\nThen write something, yeah it might be worthless\nThen paint something then, it might be wordless\nPointless curses, nonsense verses\nYou'll see purpose start to surface\nNo one else is dealing with your demons\nMeaning maybe defeating them\nCould be the beginning of your meaning, friend.\nGo away [4x]\nLeave me alone [7x]\nNobody thinks what you think, no one\nEmpathy might be on the brink of extinction\nThey will play a game and say\nThey know what you're going through\nAnd I tried to come up with an artistic way to say\nThey don't know you, and neither do I\nSo here's a prime example of a stand up guy\nWho hates what he believes and loves it at the same time\nHere's my brother and his head's screwed up\nBut that's alright.\n[Zack:]\nTime gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em\nI'm winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after\nA re-beginning moments mending memories\nPretending enemies are frenemies, sending me straight to bending me\nMy bad behaviour but I bet I could have been a better man\nCopy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me\nThe better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet I'll battle with 'em battle\nBetter I am, gambling man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?\nGo away [4x]\nLeave me alone [4x]\nLeave me alone\nDon't leave me alone.\nOh [5x]",
