How high? How high?\nYou're true and pure\nYou hold the cure\nWe're all diseased\nYou hold the key.\nYou're an angel fallen down, won't you tell us of the clouds\nYou have fallen from the sky. How high? How high?\n[7x]\nTell our dad, \"I'm sorry.\"\n[5x]\nYou're an angel\n[3x]\nTell our dad, \"I'm sorry.\"\nYou're an angel", "title": "Ruby", "album": "Regional At Best"}
