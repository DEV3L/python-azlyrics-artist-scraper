  "lyrics": "Ruby, I hope I see you, I've waited all this week\nFor you to walk my way, your soul will capture me\nYour mama painted your room, \"A shade of pink,\" she said\nBut with your great arrival that shade has turned to red.\nRuby, take my hand, please lead me to the Promised Land\nTell me where am I from? Your eyes say, \"Shada de da dum.\"\nRuby, you're royalty in your home land, they all call you \"Queen\"\nTell me, where are you from? Your eyes say, \"Shada de da dum.\"\n[2x]\nYou're an angel fallen down. Won't you tell us of the clouds?\nYou have fallen from the sky. How high? How high?\nYou're true and pure\nYou hold the cure\nWe're all diseased\nYou hold the key.\nYou're an angel fallen down. Won't you tell us of the clouds?\nYou have fallen from the sky. How high? How high? How high?\n[7x]\nTell our dad I'm sorry.\n[5x]\nYou're an angel\n[3x]\nTell our dad I'm sorry.\n[2x]\nYou're an angel",
