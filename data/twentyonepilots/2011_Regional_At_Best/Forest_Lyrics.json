  "lyrics": "I don't know why I feed on emotion\nThere's a stomach inside my brain\nI don't wanna be heard\nI wanna be listened to\nDoes it bother anyone else\nThat someone else has your name?\nDoes it bother anyone else\nThat someone else has your name, your name?\nI scream, you scream, we all scream\n'Cause we're terrified of what's around the corner\nWe stay in place\n'Cause we don't wanna lose our lives\nSo let's think of something better.\nDown in the forest\nWe'll sing a chorus\nOne that everybody knows\nHands held higher,\nWe'll be on fire\nSinging songs that nobody wrote.\nMy brain has given up\nWhite flags are hoisted\nI took some food for thought\nIt might be poisoned\nThe stomach in my brain\nThrows up onto the page\nDoes it bother anyone else\nThat someone else has your name?\nDoes it bother anyone else\nThat someone else has your name?\nI scream, you scream, we all scream\n'Cause we're terrified of what's around the corner\nWe stay in place\n'Cause we don't wanna lose our lives\nSo let's think of something better.\nDown in the forest\nWe'll sing a chorus\nOne that everybody knows\nHands held higher,\nWe'll be on fire\nSinging songs that nobody wrote.\nQuickly moving towards the storm\nMoving forward, torn\nInto pieces over reasons\nOf what these storms are for\nI don't understand why everything I adore\nTakes a different form when I squint my eyes\nHave you ever done that?\nWhen you squint your eyes\nAnd your eyelashes make it look a little not right\nAnd then when just enough light\nComes from just the right side\nAnd you find you're not who you're supposed to be?\nThis is not what you're supposed to see\nPlease, remember me. I am supposed to be\nKing of a kingdom or swinging on a swing\nSomething happened to my imagination\nThe situation's becoming dire\nMy tree house is on fire\nAnd for some reason I smell gas on my hands\nThis is not what I had planned\nThis is not what I had planned.\nDown in the forest\nWe'll sing a chorus\nHands held higher,\nWe'll be on fire\nSinging songs that nobody wrote.\nDown in the forest\nWe'll sing a chorus\nOne that everybody knows\nHands held higher,\nWe'll be on fire\nSinging songs that nobody wrote.\nHands held higher,\nWe'll be on fire\nHands held higher,\nWe'll be on fire",
