  "lyrics": "You say things with your mouth\nCobwebs and flies come out\nI hear a second voice behind your tongue somehow\nLuckily I can read your mind\nFlies and cobwebs unwind\nThey will not take you down\nThey will not cast you out, out.\nDear friend, here we are again pretending\nTo understand how you think your world is ending\nSending signals and red flags in waves\nIt's hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days\nI'll pray that one day you see\nThe only difference between life and dying\nIs one is trying, that's all we're gonna do\nSo try to love me and I'll try to save you.\n[2x]\nWon't you stay alive\nI'll take you on a ride\nI will make you believe you are lovely.\nYour redemption won't grow stale\nWe are now just setting sail\nOn the seas of what we fear\nTreason now is growing near to me\nI'm coming clean\nGod, hit me straight on. [2x]\n[2x]\nWon't you stay alive\nI'll take you on a ride\nI will make you believe you are lovely.\n[New version's addition:]\nYou say things with your mouth,\nCobwebs and flies come out.\nI hear a second voice behind your tongue somehow\nLuckily, I can read your mind\n[5x]\nDon't be gone\n[6x]\nYou say things with your mouth,\nCobwebs and flies come out.",
