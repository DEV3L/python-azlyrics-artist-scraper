  "lyrics": "Hey, hey, wouldn't it be great, great,\nIf we could just lay down and wake up in Slowtown,\nToday, day, I want to go away, way,\n'Cause things are too fast now,\nI want to be in Slowtown.\nI put my socks on my feet,\nJust so that my soul won't fall through my toes,\nAnd I walk through my door,\nJust so I don't fall through the floor.\nI remember when my brother and other kids from neighboring houses,\nWould get together, I'd ride my bike and my brother would ride his,\nPut cards in our spokes and make our engine sound like traffic,\nWhen using Pok\u00e9mon cards, please do not use the holographics,\nSo bold and fearless in the risks we take,\nLaugh in the face of gravity as its laws we'd break,\nOn trampolines so high, we reach for the sky, but I,\nDo not look up anymore and I don't know why.\nI put my socks on my feet,\nJust so that my soul won't fall through my toes,\nAnd I walk through my door,\nJust so I don't fall through the floor.\n[3x:]\nWe're going too fast, fast, save us.\nWe're going too fast, fast, save us.\nWe're going too fast, fast, save us now.\nI walk through my door,\nJust so I don't fall through the floor.\nHey, hey, wouldn't it be great, great,\nIf we could just lay down and wake up in Slowtown,\nJust singing.",
