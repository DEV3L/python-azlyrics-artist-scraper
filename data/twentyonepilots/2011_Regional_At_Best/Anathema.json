{"year": "2011", "lyrics": "You will never know what's behind my skull\nSo won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.\nYou will never know what's under my hair\nSo won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.\nYou will never know what's under my skin\nSo won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.\nYou will never know what is in my veins\nSo won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.\nWon't you go to someone else's dreams\nWon't you go to someone else's head\nHaven't you taken enough from me\nWon't you torture someone else's sleep?\nAnd you will never know what I'm thinking of\nSo won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye\nAnd you will never understand what I believe\nSo won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.\nHaven't you taken enough from me\nWon't you torture someone else's sleep?\nWon't you go to someone else's dreams\nWon't you go to someone else's head.\nHaven't you taken enough from me\nWon't you torture someone else's sleep?\nI start to part two halves of my heart in the dark and I\nDon't know where I should go\nAnd the tears and the fears begin to multiply\nTaking time in a simple place\nIn my bed where my head rests on a pillowcase\nAnd it's said that a war's lead but I forget\nThat I let another day go by\nI want to be afraid but it seems that these days\nI'm caught under water and I'm falling farther\nMy heart's getting harder, I'm calling my father\nAm I screaming to an empty sky?\nEmpty sky, no way, that's me 'cause one half of my heart is free\nEmpty sky, no way, that's me 'cause the other half of my heart's asleep.", "title": "Anathema", "album": "Regional At Best"}
