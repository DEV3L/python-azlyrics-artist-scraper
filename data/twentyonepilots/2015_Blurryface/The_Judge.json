{"year": "2015", "lyrics": "Na na na na, oh oh\nNa na na na, oh oh\nNa na na na, oh oh\nWhen the leader of the bad guys sang,\nSomething soft and soaked in pain,\nI heard the echo from his secret hideaway,\nHe must've forgot to close his door,\nAs he cranked out those dismal chords,\nAnd his four walls declared him insane.\nI found my way,\nRight time, wrong place,\nAs I pled my case.\nYou're the judge, oh no, set me free,\nYou're the judge, oh no, set me free,\nI know my soul's freezing,\nHell's hot for good reason, so please, take me.\nNa na na na, oh oh\nNa na na na, oh oh\nNa na na na, oh oh\nThree lights are lit but the fourth one's out,\nI can tell 'cause it's a bit darker than the last night's bout,\nI forgot about the drought of light bulbs in this house,\nSo I head out, down a route I think is heading south,\nBut I'm not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth,\nI'm a pro at imperfections and I'm best friends with my doubt,\nAnd now that my mind's out, and now I hear it clear and loud,\nI'm thinking, \"Wow, I probably shoulda stayed inside my house.\"\nI found my way,\nRight time, wrong place,\nAs I pled my case.\nYou're the judge, oh no, set me free,\nYou're the judge, oh no, set me free,\nI know my soul's freezing,\nHell's hot for good reason, so please,\nI don't know if this song is a surrender or a revel,\nI don't know if this one is about me or the devil.\nI don't know if this song is a surrender or a revel,\nI don't know if this one is about me or the devil.\nYou're the judge, oh no, set me free, oh no\nYou're the judge, oh no, set me free, oh no\nI know my soul's freezing,\nHell's hot for good reason, so please,\nNa na na na, oh oh\nNa na na na, oh oh\nNa na na na, oh oh\nNa na na na, oh oh (You're the judge, oh no, set me free)\nNa na na na, oh oh (You're the judge, oh no, set me free)\nNa na na na, oh oh (You're the judge, oh no, set me free)\n(Josh Dun!)\n(You're the judge, oh no, set me free)", "title": "The Judge", "album": "Blurryface"}
