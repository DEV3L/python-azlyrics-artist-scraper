{"year": "2015", "lyrics": "Scared of my own image, scared of my own immaturity,\nScared of my own ceiling, scared I'll die of uncertainty,\nFear might be the death of me, fear leads to anxiety,\nDon't know what's inside of me.\nDon't forget about me,\nDon't forget about me,\nEven when I doubt you,\nI'm no good without you, no, no\nTemperature is dropping, temperature is dropping,\nI'm not sure if I can see this ever stopping,\nShaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts, no,\nYou are all that I've got, no.\nDon't forget about me,\nDon't forget about me,\nEven when I doubt you,\nI'm no good without you, no, no, no, no, no\nGnawing on the bishops, claw our way up their system,\nRepeating simple phrases, someone holy insisted,\nI want the markings made on my skin,\nTo mean something to me again,\nHope you haven't left without me.\nHope you haven't left without me, please.\n[2x]\nDon't forget about me,\nDon't forget about me,\nEven when I doubt you,\nI'm no good without you, no, no, no, no\nHey! Hey!\nDon't forget about me, no\nHey! Hey!\nDon't forget about me, no\nHey! Hey!\nDon't forget about me, no\nHey! Hey!\nDon't forget about me, no", "title": "Doubt", "album": "Blurryface"}
