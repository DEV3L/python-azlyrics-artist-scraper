  "lyrics": "They say, \"Stay in your lane, boy, lane boy,\"\nBut we go where we want to\nThey think this thing is a highway, highway,\nBut will they be alive tomorrow?\nThey think this thing is a highway\nIf it was our way\nWe'd have a tempo change every other time change\n'Cause our minds change on what we think is good\nI wasn't raised in the hood,\nBut I know a thing or two about pain and darkness\nIf it wasn't for this music, I don't know how I would've fought this\nRegardless,\nAll these songs I'm hearing are so heartless\nDon't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless\nHonest,\nThere's a few songs on this record that feel common\nI'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'\nIn the industry\nIt seems to me\nThat singles on the radio are currency\nMy creativity's only free when I'm playin' shows\nThey say, \"Stay in your lane, boy, lane boy,\"\nBut we go where we want to\nThey think this thing is a highway, highway,\nBut will they be alive tomorrow?\nWill they be alive tomorrow?\nI'm sorry if that question I asked last\nScared you a bit like a hazmat\nIn a gas mask\nIf you ask Zack\nHe's my brother, he likes when I rap fast\nBut let's back track,\nBack to this\nWho would you live and die for on that list?\nBut the problem is\nThere's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this\nForget sanity,\nForget salary,\nForget vanity,\nMy morality\nIf you get in between someone I love and me\nYou're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry\nAll these songs I'm hearing are so heartless\nDon't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless\nThey say, \"Stay in your lane, boy, lane boy,\"\nBut we go where we want to\nThey think this thing is a highway, highway,\nBut will they be alive tomorrow?\nThey say, \"Stay in your lane, boy, lane boy,\"\nBut we go where we want to\nThey think this thing is a highway, highway,\nBut will they be alive tomorrow?\nWill they be alive tomorrow? [4x]\nThey say, \"Stay in your lane, boy, lane boy,\"\nBut we go where we want to\nThey think this thing is a highway, highway,\nBut will they be alive tomorrow?\nThey say, \"Stay in your lane, boy, lane boy,\"\nBut we go where we want to\nThey think this thing is a highway, highway,\nBut will they be alive tomorrow?",
