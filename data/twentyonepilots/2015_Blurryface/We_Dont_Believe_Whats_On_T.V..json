[2x]\nAlright. Second verse.\nWhat if my dream does not happen?\nWould I just change what I've told my friends?\nDon't wanna know who I would be,\nWhen I wake up from a dreamer's sleep.\nI need to know that when I fail you'll still be here,\n'Cause if you stick around I'll sing you pretty sounds,\nAnd we'll make money selling your hair.\nBut I don't care what's in your hair,\nI just wanna know what's on your mind,\nI used to say, \"I wanna die before I'm old,\"\nBut because of you I might think twice.\nI don't care what's in your hair,\nI just wanna know what's on your mind,\nI used to say, \"I wanna die before I'm old,\"\nBut because of you I might think twice.\nYeah, yeah, yeah!
