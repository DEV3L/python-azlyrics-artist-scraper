  "lyrics": "I don't know why, I just feel I'm better off,\nStaying in the same room I was born in,\nI look outside, and see a whole world better off,\nWithout me in it trying to transform it,\nYou are out of my mind, you aren't seeing my side,\nYou waste all this time trying to get to me,\nBut you are out of my mind,\nListen, I know this one's a contradiction because of how happy it sounds,\nBut the lyrics are so down,\nIt's OK though, because it represents, wait better yet, it is,\nWho I feel I am right now,\nYou are out of my mind, you aren't seeing my side,\nYou waste all this time trying to get to me,\nBut you are out of my mind,\nHeard you say, \"Not today.\"\nTore the curtains down, windows open now, make a sound,\nHeard your voice, \"There's no choice.\"\nTore the curtains down, windows open now, make a noise,\nDon't you test me though, just because I play the piano,\nDoesn't mean I am not willing to take you down, I'm sorry\nI'm, I'm out of my mind, I'm not seeing things right,\nI waste all this time trying to run from you,\nBut I'm, I'm out of my mind.\nHeard you say, \"Not today.\"\nTore the curtains down, windows open now, make a sound,\nHeard your voice, \"There's no choice.\"\nTore the curtains down, windows open now, make a noise,\nYou are out of my mind, you aren't seeing my side,\nYou waste all this time trying to get to me,\nBut you are out of my mind,\nHeard you say, \"Not today.\"\nTore the curtains down, windows open now, make a sound,\nHeard your voice, \"There's no choice.\"\nTore the curtains down, windows open now, make a noise.\nBuh buh bah, buh buh bah\nBah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah\nBuh buh bah, buh buh bah\nBah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah\nBuh buh bah, not today (not today)\nBah bah bah bah bah (not today), bah bah bah bah bah (not today, no, not today)\nBuh buh bah, buh buh bah (not today, oh nah nah no)\nBah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh",
