  "lyrics": "There's an infestation in my mind's imagination,\nI hope that they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smoking them out the basement,\nThis is not rap, this is not hip-hop,\nJust another attempt to make the voices stop,\nRapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something,\n'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushing to say nothing,\nThis doesn't mean I lost my dream,\nIt's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean.\nGangsters don't cry,\nTherefore, therefore I'm,\nMr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm.\nCan you save, can you save my\u2014\nCan you save my heavydirtysoul?\nCan you save, can you save my\u2014\nCan you save my heavydirtysoul?\nFor me, for me, uh\nCan you save my heavydirtysoul?\nFor me, for me, uh\nCan you save my heavydirtysoul?\nNah, I didn't understand a thing you said,\nIf I didn't know better I'd guess you're all already dead,\nMindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch,\nSaying stuff like, \"You only live once.\"\nYou've got one time to figure it out,\nOne time to twist and one time to shout,\nOne time to think and I say we start now,\nSing it with me if you know what I'm talking about.\nGangsters don't cry,\nTherefore, therefore I'm,\nMr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm.\nCan you save, can you save my\u2014\nCan you save my heavydirtysoul?\nCan you save, can you save my\u2014\nCan you save my heavydirtysoul?\nFor me, for me, uh\nCan you save my heavydirtysoul?\nFor me, for me, uh\nCan you save my heavydirtysoul?\nDeath inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit. [2x]\nCan you save, can you save my\u2014\nCan you save my heavydirtysoul?\nCan you save, can you save my\u2014\nCan you save my heavydirtysoul?\nFor me, for me, uh\nCan you save my heavydirtysoul?\nFor me, for me, uh\nCan you save my heavydirtysoul?\nCan you save, can you save my\u2014save my\u2014\nCan you save my heavydirtysoul?\nCan you save, can you save my\u2014save my\u2014\nCan you save my heavydirtysoul?",
