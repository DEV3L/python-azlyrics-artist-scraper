Eh!)\nA loser hides behind a mask of my disguise,\nAnd who I am today is worse than other times,\nYou don't know what I've done, I'm wanted and on the run.\nI'm wanted and on the run.\nSo I'm taking this moment to live in the future\nRelease me from the present,\nI'm obsessing all these questions,\nWhy I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session,\nPlease use discretion when you're messing with the message, man,\nThese lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand.\nEh! Eh! Eh! Eh!\nEh! Eh! Eh! Eh!\nNo no no no no no (Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!)\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!)\nYou don't know my brain the way you know my name,\nYou don't know my heart the way you know my face,\nYou don't know what I've done, I'm wanted and on the run.\nI'm wanted and on the run.\nSo I'm taking this moment to live in the future\nRelease me from the present,\nI'm obsessing all these questions,\nWhy I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session,\nPlease use discretion when you're messing with the message, man,\nThese lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand.\nMy people singing\nMy people singing\nHope you're dead\n'Cause how could you sleep at a time like this,\nPeople, they rhyme like this,\nWe're all impressed by this,\nThey rip it, flip it,\nBut these are just triplets,\nWrote this in three minutes, three words to a line,\nIt's just poetry divided.\nI'm the kind of guy\nWho takes every moment he knows he confided in music to use it\nFor others to use it,\nYou're dead\n'Cause how could you sleep at a time like this.\nLife is up here, but you comment below,\nAnd the comments will always become common motivation to promote\nYour show's next episode,\nSo your brain knows to keep going even though hope is far from this moment,\nBut you and I know it gets better when morning finally rears its head.\nTogether we're losers,\nRemember the future,\nRemember the morning is when night is dead.\nRelease me from the present,\nI'm obsessing all these questions,\nWhy I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session,\nPlease use discretion when you're messing with the message, man,\nThese lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand.\nPlease use discretion when you're messing with the message, man,\nThese lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand.\nMy people singing\nMy people singing\nMy people singing", "title": "Message Man", "album": "Blurryface"}
