  "lyrics": "Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet\nAnd ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe\nAnd though I feed on things that fell\nYou can learn to levitate with just a little help\nLearn to levitate with just a little help\nCome down, come down\nCowards only come through when the hour's late\nAnd everyone's asleep, mind you\nNow show up, show up\nI know I shouldn't say this\nBut a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man\nCome down, come down\nCowards only come through when the hour's late\nAnd everyone's asleep, mind you\nNow show up, show up\nI know I shouldn't say this\nBut a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man\nDanger in the fabric of this thing I made\nI probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late\nMy heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made\nNow they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say\nThey're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above\nBut this is not enough\nYeah, this is not what you thought\nNo, no we are not just graffiti on a passing train\nI got back what I once bought back\nIn that slot I won't need to replace\nThis culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today\nDon't feed me to the vultures\nI am a vulture who feeds on pain\nSleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through\nAnd sever all I knew, yeah, sever all\nI thought I could depend on my weekends\nOn the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on\nPlease, keep me from; please, keep me down from the ledges\nBetter test it, wooden wedges under doorways\nKeep your wooden wedges under doors\nChorus, verse, chorus, verse\nNow here comes the eight\nWait, habits here too\nYou're the worst, your structure compensates\nBut compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two\nAt least they all know all they hear comes from a place\nOh, I know how to levitate up off my feet\nAnd ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe\nAnd though I feed on things that fell\nYou can learn to levitate with just a little help\nYou can levitate with just a little help\nWelcome to Trench",
