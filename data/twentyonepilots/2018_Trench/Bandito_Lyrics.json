  "lyrics": "I could take the high road\nBut I know that I'm going low\nI'm a ban-I'm a bandito\nI could take the high road\nBut I know that I'm going low\nI'm a ban-I'm a bandito\nI could take the high road\nBut I know that I'm going low\nI'm a ban-I'm a bandito\nThis is the sound we make\nWhen in between two places\nWhere we used to bleed\nAnd where our blood needs to be\nI could take the high road\nBut I know that I'm going low\nI'm a ban-I'm a bandito\nI could take the high road\nBut I know that I'm going low\nI'm a ban-I'm a bandito\nIn city, I feel my spirit is contained\nLike neon inside the glass, they form my brain\nBut I recently discovered\nIt's a heatless fire\nLike nicknames they give themselves to uninspire\nBegin with bullet, now add fire to the proof\nBut I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or a close relative to truth\nEither way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you\nThe softest echo could be enough for me to make it through\n(Sahlo Folina...)\nI created this world\nTo feel some control\nDestroy it if I want\nSo I sing\n(Sahlo Folina...)\nI could take the high road\nBut I know that I'm going low\nI'm a ban-I'm a bandito\nI could take the high road\nBut I know that I'm going low\nI'm a ban-I'm a bandito\nI could take the high road\nBut I know that I'm going low\nI'm a ban-I'm a bandito\nI created this world\nTo feel some control\nDestroy it if I want\nSo I sing\n(Sahlo Folina...)",
