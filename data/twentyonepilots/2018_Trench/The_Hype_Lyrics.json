  "lyrics": "Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed\nMy interior world needs to sanitize\nI've got to step through or I'll dissipate\nI'll record my step through for my basement tapes\nNice to know my kind will be on my side\nI don't believe the hype\nAnd you know you're a terrible sight\nBut you'll be just fine\nJust don't believe the hype\nYeah, they might be talking behind your head\nYour exterior world can step off instead\nIt might take some friends and a warmer shirt\nBut you don't get thick skin without getting burnt\nNice to know my kind will be on my side\nI don't believe the hype\nAnd you know you're a terrible sight\nBut you'll be just fine\nJust don't believe the hype\nNo, I don't know which way I'm going\nBut I can hear my way around\nNo, I don't know which way I'm going\nBut I can hear my way around\nNo, I don't know which way I'm going\nBut I can hear my way around\nNo, I don't know which way I'm going\nBut I can hear my way around\nBut I can hear my way around\nNice to know my kind will be on my side\nI don't believe the hype\nAnd you know you're a terrible sight\nBut you'll be just fine\nJust don't believe the hype (don't believe the hype)\nNice to know my kind will be on my side\nI don't believe the hype\nAnd you know you're a terrible sight\nBut you'll be just fine\nJust don't believe the hype\nNice to know my kind will be on my side\nI don't believe the hype\nAnd you know you're a terrible sight\nBut you'll be just fine\nJust don't believe the hype",
