  "lyrics": "(So where are you? It's been a little while...)\nSippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibe slide over me\nThis beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical\nWhen I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete\nThe moment is medical, moment is medical\nSippin' on straight chlorine\nLovin' what I'm tastin'\nVenom on my tongue\nDependent at times\nPoisonous vibration\nHelp my body run\nI'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe\nRunnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe\nSippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibe slide over me\nThis beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical\nWhen I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete\nThe moment is medical, moment is medical\nSippin' on straight chlorine\nFall out of formation\nI plan my escape from walls they confined\nRebel red carnation\nGrows while I decay\nI'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe\nRunnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe\nYeah, I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe\nRunnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe\nHide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red\nI felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head\nNow different lives I lead, my body lives on lead\nThe last two lines may read incorrect until said\nThe lead is terrible in flavor\nBut now you double as a papermaker\nI despise you sometimes\nI love to hate the fight and you in my life is like\nSippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibe slide over me\nThis beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical\nWhen I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete\nThe moment is medical, moment is medical\nSippin' on straight chlorine\n(Let the vibe, let the vibe)\n(Let the vibe, let the vibe)\nBeat is a chemical, yeah\n(Let the vibe, let the vibe)\n(Let the vibe, let the vibe)\nMoment is medical, yeah\nSippin' on straight chlorine\n(Let the vibe, let the vibe)\n(Let the vibe, let the vibe)\nBeat is a chemical, yeah\n(Let the vibe, let the vibe)\n(Let the vibe, let the vibe)\nMoment is medical, yeah\nI'm so sorry, I forgot you\nLet me catch you up to speed\nI've been tested like the end of\nA weathered flag that's by the sea\nCan you build my house with pieces?\nI'm just a chemical\nCan you build my house with pieces?\nI'm just a chemical\nCan you build my house with pieces?\nI'm just a chemical\nCan you build my house with pieces?\nI'm just a chemical",
