{"year": "2013", "lyrics": "Night falls with gravity,\nThe earth turns from sanity,\nTaking my only friend I know,\nHe leaves a lot, his name is \"Hope\".\nI'm never what I like,\nI'm double sided, and I just can't hide,\nI kind of like it when I make you cry,\n'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up inside.\nThe horrors of the night melt away,\nUnder the warm glow of survival of the day,\nThen we move on,\nMy shadow grows taller, along with my fears,\nAnd my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near.\nWhen the sun is climbing window sills,\nAnd the silver lining rides the hills,\nI will be saved for one whole day,\nUntil the sun makes the hills its grave.\nI'm never what I like,\nI'm double sided, and I just can't hide,\nI kind of like it when I make you cry,\n'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up inside.\nI'm never what I like,\nI'm double sided, and I just can't hide,\nI kind of like it when I make you cry,\n'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up inside my mind.\nDoo,\nDoo, doo, doo-doo-doo... [8x]\nDoo\n[4x:]\nI'm semi-automatic, my prayer's schizophrenic,\nBut I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on.\nBy the time the night wears off,\nThe dust is down and shadows burn,\nI will rise and stand my ground,\nWaiting for the night's return.\nI'm never what I like,\nI'm double sided, and I just can't hide,\nI kind of like it when I make you cry,\n'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up inside.\nI'm never what I like,\nI'm double sided, and I just can't hide,\nI kind of like it when I make you cry,\n'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up inside my mind.\nDoo,\nDoo, doo, doo-doo-doo...
