  "lyrics": "She asked me, \"Son, when I grow old,\nWill you buy me a house of gold?\nAnd when your father turns to stone,\nWill you take care of me?\"\nShe asked me, \"Son, when I grow old,\nWill you buy me a house of gold?\nAnd when your father turns to stone,\nWill you take care of me?\"\nI will make you queen of everything you see,\nI'll put you on the map,\nI'll cure you of disease.\nLet's say we up and left this town,\nAnd turned our future upside down.\nWe'll make pretend that you and me,\nLived ever after happily.\nShe asked me, \"Son, when I grow old,\nWill you buy me a house of gold?\nAnd when your father turns to stone,\nWill you take care of me?\"\nI will make you queen of everything you see,\nI'll put you on the map,\nI'll cure you of disease.\nOhhhh...\nAnd since we know that dreams are dead,\nAnd life turns plans up on their head,\nI will plan to be a bum,\nSo I just might become someone.\nShe asked me, \"Son, when I grow old,\nWill you buy me a house of gold?\nAnd when your father turns to stone,\nWill you take care of me?\"\nI will make you queen of everything you see,\nI'll put you on the map,\nI'll cure you of disease.",
