{"year": "2013", "lyrics": "I want to drive away\nIn the night, headlights call my name\nI, I'll never be, be what you see inside\nYou say I'm not alone, but I am petrified\nYou say that you are close, is close the closest star?\nYou just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far\nAnd I'll fall\nAnd I'll break\nAnd I'll fake\nAll I wanna\nAnd I'll fall down\nAnd I'll break down\nAnd I'll fake you out\nAll I wanna\nI'm so afraid\nOf what you have to say\nCause I am quiet now\nAnd silence gives you space\nI'll never be, be what you see inside\nYou say I'm not alone, but I am petrified\nYou say that you are close, is close the closest star?\nYou just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far\nAnd I'll fall\nAnd I'll break\nAnd I'll fake\nAll I wanna\nAnd I'll fall down\nAnd I'll break down\nAnd I'll fake you out\nAll I wanna\nIt's the same game today as it always is\nI don't give these places fake my name explaining this\nAnd the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines\nThat remind me of all the times...\nI have committed\nDirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted\nTo what I've done and what I'm doing\nI'm brewing and losing and spewing infusing\nAnd believe me that's what all the kids are doing\nWhat kids are doing are killing themselves\nThey feel they have no control of their prisoner's cell\nAnd if you're one of them then you're one of me\nAnd you would do almost anything just to feel free...\nAm I right? Of course I am\nConvince me otherwise would take all night\nBefore you walk away, there's one more thing I want to say\nOur brains are sick but that's okay\nAnd I'll fall\nAnd I'll break\nAnd I'll fake\nAll I wanna\nAll I wanna\nYeah, and I'll fall down\nAnd I'll break down\nAnd I'll fake you out\nAll I wanna\nYeah, and I'll fall down\nAnd I'll break down\nAnd I'll fake you out\nAll I wanna\nI'm so afraid\nOf what you have to say\nCause I am quiet now\nAnd silence gives you space", "title": "Fake You Out", "album": "Vessel"}
