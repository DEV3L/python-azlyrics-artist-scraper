{"year": "2013", "lyrics": "I do not know why I would go\nIn front of you and hide my soul\n'Cause you're the only one who knows it,\nYeah, you're the only one who knows it\nAnd I will hide behind my pride\nDon't know why I think I can lie\n'Cause there's a screen on my chest\nYeah, there's a screen on my chest\n[2x]\nI'm standing in front of you\nI'm standing in front of you\nI'm trying to be so cool\nEverything together trying to be so cool\nI can't see past my own nose, I'm seeing everything in slo-mo\nLook out below crashing down to the ground just like a vertical locomotive\nThat's a train. Am I painting the picture that's in my brain?\nA train from the sky, locomotive, my motives are insane\nMy flow's not great, OK, I conversate with people\nWho know if I flow on a song I'll get no radio play\nWhile you're doing fine, there's some people and I\nWho have a really tough time getting through this life\nSo excuse us while we sing to the sky.\n[2x]\nI'm standing in front of you\nI'm standing in front of you\nI'm trying to be so cool\nEverything together trying to be so cool\nOoh-oh, ooh-oh-oh\nOh-ooh-oh...\n[3x]\nWe're broken\nWe're broken\nWe're broken\nWe're broken people, oh.\nWe're broken people, oh.\nYeah\n[2x]\nWe're broken\nWe're broken\nWe're broken\nWe're broken people, oh.\nWe're broken people, oh.\n[2x]\nI'm standing in front of you\nI'm standing in front of you\nI'm trying to be so cool\nEverything together trying to be so cool", "title": "Screen", "album": "Vessel"}
